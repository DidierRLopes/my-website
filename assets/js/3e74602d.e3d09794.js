On the one hand, it's your door to the world and what's happening. On the other hand, it's your door to the world and what's happening. I say it this way because this can be extremely good or bad depending on the use case. Phones are optimized for users to spend time on them, apps are optimized to provide dopamine hits so users use them for longer. Notifications will interrupt you throughout the day so you remember to go back to the app, etc.. But sometimes you only want to do 1 thing, and don't want to be distracted from it. The best example are E-Books. You can read on your phone, iPad or laptop - yet people decide to buy a kindle so they can just do that. Read with no distractions. You are paying a premium for a product to remove the distractions.

If someone gets access to your phone unlocked they have access to who you are (important emails, personal photos, chat conversations, the apps you use and how do you spend your time, the songs you listen or books you read, even confidential documents). So, there are certain scenarios where you don't want to borrow your phone to someone to do something, since that requires trust that they won't see anything that is confidential. I think Rabbit r1 can go after this category because its a shiny gadget that doesn't really hold any personal information from the user, and this way allows the user to keep their phone in their pocket while using rabbit r1 for some tasks that the phone could also do but would require for others to have access to it."]}),"\n"]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)("p",{align:"center",children:(0,a.jsx)("img",{width:"600",src:"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_11.png"})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"excited-about",children:"Excited about"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"developer-ecosystem",children:"Developer Ecosystem"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Apple became Apple not because of their revolutionary LCD screen without a keyboard, but because of the developer ecosystem they created.
