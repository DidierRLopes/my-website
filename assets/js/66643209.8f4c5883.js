Alignment before starting\n\n- Restate my goal in your own words.\n- List unknowns and ask clarifying questions until the request is unambiguous.\n- Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.\n\n## 3. Implementation Planning\n\n### 3.1 Plan of attack\n\n- Create a step-by-step plan with small, verifiable commits.\n- Include a rollback plan.\n- Wait for my go-ahead before writing code.\n\n### 3.2 Change surface\n\n- List all files you expect to modify.\n- If you are going to add 1 or more new files ask me permission to do so and explain what is the purpose of each of the files created. And why you couldn't use the others available.\n- If you are going to delete 1 or more files ask me permission to do so and tell me what the file used to do and why you want to get rid of it.\n\n### 3.3 Edge cases list\n\n- Enumerate edge cases, failure modes, and concurrency/race concerns.\n- State how each will be handled.\n\n### 3.4 Testing strategy\n\n- Assume I will run tests/builds. Do not run the build.\n- Add lightweight debug hooks (console.log or equivalent) at key points so I can verify behavior quickly.\n- Outline what to test and expected outputs, but only include actual tests if I explicitly ask.\n\n### 3.5 Reuse before rebuild\n\n- Identify existing utilities/hooks/services to reuse.\n- If introducing a new abstraction, justify why reuse isn\u2019t sufficient.\n\n### 3.6 MVP first (divide to conquer)\n\n- Propose a simplistic first pass to validate direction (minimal interface, happy path).\n- Plan the follow-up phases to complete the full implementation after MVP is confirmed.\n\n## 4. Step phased plan (detailed prompt)\n\nUse the agreed Design/PRD, that we iterated together, as the single source of truth. Before coding, produce a 5\u20138 step phased plan. Each phase specifies goals, files to touch, and, when helpful, tiny code diffs/pseudocode (<15 lines). Keep phases minimal, shippable, and verifiable.\n\nDeliverables before coding:\n- a. Goal restatement & acceptance criteria.\n- b. Repo scan & reuse targets.\n- c. Implementation plan (5\u20138 phases) with file changes and small diffs.\n- d. Testing strategy with debug logs I can use.\n- e. Risks & rollback.\n- f. Clarifying questions if any ambiguity remains.\n\n## 5. Code Style & Comments\n\n- Avoid line-by-line comments.\n- Comment only where logic is non-obvious.\n\n## 6. During Execution\n\n- If blocked or uncertain, stop and present 2\u20133 options with pros/cons; confirm before proceeding.\n- Stick to the plan and scope; confirm any scope expansion first.\n- Keep diffs small and mapped to phases; include the debug logs defined in 3.4.\n"})}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"One of the reasons for which it\u2019s important to have such an extensive/detailed prompt is that is VERY easy (I cannot emphasis this enough) to get stuck in a loop."}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["The amount of times I had to ",(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"git restore"})," or ",(0,o.jsx)(n.code,{children:"git stash"})," and start from scratch is mind blowing.
