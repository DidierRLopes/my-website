But when Carolina and Oscar showed me what they were building at [C-MORE](https://cmore-sustainability.com/) - verified ESG data meets AI - and we started collaborating informally, formalizing it as an advisor role was the obvious next step.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nI\'ve been hands-on with AI and machine learning since 2016, when I first applied Neural Networks to control systems in university. Since then, I\'ve stayed close to the intersection of data, AI, and finance - implementing LSTM networks for financial time series forecasting ([open-sourced here](/blog/an-unusual-journey-learning-about-nns-for-a-phd-thesis)), and more recently fine-tuning small language models running locally ([detailed here](/blog/fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts)).\\n\\nAt OpenBB, we\'ve built an AI agent that helps analysts interact with any data in the workspace. I\'ve learned firsthand what it takes to make AI systems trustworthy: clean data, traceable reasoning, and evidence-based outputs.\\n\\nLast year, I met Carolina and Oscar from C-MORE. Carolina is pursuing a PhD in Sustainability, Oscar brings deep Corporate Finance experience, and together they weren\'t just running a profitable, fast-growing company - they were getting their hands dirty with AI to out-innovate their competition.\\n\\nWe connected immediately. We\'re from Portugal and Spain, share similar values about building, and think long-term. And Carina, their co-founder, is actually from my hometown in Portugal (my quarterly reminder of how small the world is).\\n\\nWe started collaborating informally. We held discussions regarding approaches for parsing complex documents with Gemini\'s long-context models. We talked through their AI strategy. The conversations kept getting deeper.\\n\\nEventually, they asked to formalize the relationship. For me, it was a no-brainer - we were already working together, just without the paperwork.\\n\\n## Why C-MORE\\n\\nC-MORE is building one of the most advanced platforms in the world for operational risk and sustainability management.\\n\\nThey automate ESG data collection, cleaning, and analysis - transforming how companies understand and improve their environmental and social performance. Their software is already trusted by 100+ clients across finance, real estate, energy, and supply chain management.\\n\\nBut here\'s what matters: their data is verified by SGS, ensuring audit-ready quality. In a space where data integrity is everything, this is a massive differentiator.\\n\\nC-MORE\'s mission is to use automation and intelligence to create a more efficient, transparent, and sustainable future. And I\'m a believer in the team executing on it.\\n\\n## Strong foundation\\n\\nIf there\'s one thing I\'ve learned building AI systems, it\'s this: data is everything. Specifically, data that\'s clean, structured, and verified - exactly what C-MORE has spent years building.\\n\\nTheir data pipelines and collection processes are second to none. Over the past months, I\'ve been helping the team think through their AI strategy - shaping how they approach evidence-based, traceable ESG answers.\\n\\n## Why now\\n\\nThe timing couldn\'t be better.\\n\\nRegulatory frameworks like CSRD, CSDDD, and the EU Taxonomy are making ESG transparency mandatory. Investors are demanding verifiable data. Companies are under pressure to prove, not just promise, their impact, and to do so without exposing themselves to financial or reputational risk.\\n\\nMost ESG and operational-risk workflows today remain manual, fragmented, and costly - trapped in spreadsheets and endless verification loops.\\n\\nC-MORE changes that.\\n\\nTheir platform doesn\'t just automate ESG reporting; it provides a secure data foundation that helps organizations protect and preserve their value. By centralizing and validating ESG and risk data, C-MORE enables firms to anticipate exposure before it becomes a headline.\\n\\nAnd they\'re moving fast.\\n\\n## How this ties to OpenBB\\n\\nThis is directly relevant.\\n\\nOnce you have high-quality data and a reliable AI layer, the next challenge is delivery - how you make it accessible, useful, and intuitive for end users.\\n\\nAdvising C-MORE gives me insight into how enterprise data vendors think about that last mile. We already have community members building apps in the OpenBB workspace and sharing them, but I see an opportunity at the enterprise level: enabling vendors to take our interface and own it with their branding.\\n\\nWe already have the enterprise features - user access controls, role-based permissions, app management, shared dashboards. And we let users connect data to AI agents in an AI-first workspace.\\n\\nMy recent conversations with Oscar have been nothing short of exciting.\\n\\n**The first AI-native ESG Terminal may not be too far.**\\n\\nImagine C-MORE\'s verified, structured ESG data and AI agents wrapped in OpenBB\'s open, modular interface built for analysts and investors. I think we can offer their users an experience second to none.\\n\\n## Looking ahead\\n\\nAdvising C-MORE gives me insight into what it takes to build a large-scale data business with purpose. It\'s a chance to learn from a team solving hard problems - and to help shape how AI can make complex data transparent, actionable, and impactful.\\n\\nC-MORE is only getting started, but the trajectory is clear: the next generation of ESG intelligence will be built by those who combine clean data, strong AI, and beautiful interfaces loved by customers.\\n\\nI\'m excited about this side quest.\\n\\nIf you\'re dealing with ESG compliance, looking for better sustainability data infrastructure, or just curious about what C-MORE is building - reach out. I\'m happy to share more or make introductions to the team."},{"id":"building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code.md","title":"Building a Pokemon Card Price Estimator with Claude Code","description":"The Pokemon TCG market is inefficient.

I built a tool to exploit it.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I saw this post on X.\\n\\nThat post reminded me of my childhood, where I had a few sets of Pokemon cards. However, silly me, I sold all of those sets a few years ago when I was back home. I didn\'t even think that much about it to be honest.\\n\\nThen I talked about it with my wife, and she shared a Pokemon pop-up happening in NYC.\\n\\nWhen we were in Chelsea Market with friends visiting from out of town, we stopped by. I looked for a Kabuto card - specifically the Gen 1 version - but couldn\'t find it. So I grabbed the Gen 2 version instead, just in case.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code_1.png\\" alt=\\"Kabuto card purchase\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nAnd then I bought a booster pack. You know, just in case.\\n\\nI got home and opened it. Eleven cards stared back at me. But I had no idea what any of them were worth.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code_2.png\\" alt=\\"Booster pack cards\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nMy first instinct was to take a photo and throw it at ChatGPT: \\"How much are these worth?\\"\\n\\nThe results were... bad. The model would either not respond or confuse cards, miss some or even hallucinate prices.\\n\\nI was giving it way too much freedom. Without constraints, the model didn\'t know where to pull reliable information from. It would make up prices or reference outdated data or just plain ignore the card.\\n\\nBut anyway, after a bit of chat it was enough for me to understand that what I got sucked. So I went into eBay to see if there were good cards for sale - you know, as a \\"store of value\\".\\n\\nAnd of course, pictures on eBay are diabolical.\\n\\nAnd maybe, just maybe, there were sellers that were as clueless as I was selling Pokemon cards back a few years.\\n\\nBut I just didn\'t know how to value the cards from a picture. So I couldn\'t know if a set listed for $20 was worth $10 or $100.\\n\\nBut I knew who could.\\n\\nThe combined information from the web and a specific skillset - **ENTER CLAUDE SKILLS**.\\n\\nSo I built a Claude Code skill that does exactly that.\\n\\nThe full source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/pokemon-cards-value-scraper).\\n\\n## The workflow\\n\\n### Step 0: Find a set that you might be interested in\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code_3.png\\" alt=\\"eBay Pokemon card listing\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Step 1: Provide an Image\\n\\nDrop a photo of Pokemon cards - a binder page, a spread on a table, whatever.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code_4.png\\" alt=\\"Test Pokemon cards input\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Step 2: Card Recognition\\n\\nClaude\'s vision model analyzes the image and extracts card details into a structured table:\\n\\n| # | Name | Set | Card # | Holo | Edition |\\n|---|------|-----|--------|------|---------|\\n| 1 | Alakazam | Base Set | 1/102 | Holo | Unlimited |\\n| 2 | Blastoise | Base Set | 2/102 | Holo | Unlimited |\\n| 3 | Charizard | Base Set | 4/102 | Holo | Unlimited |\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe key here is providing clear guidelines about what to look for (set symbols, card numbers, holo patterns) and what to ignore (partially visible cards, reflections). Without these constraints, the model hallucinates. With them, it\'s remarkably accurate. And if in doubt, the model will ask to clarify.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code_5.png\\" alt=\\"Card recognition in Claude Code\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Step 3: Human-in-the-Loop Confirmation\\n\\nEven if the model was confident on the cards, it can still misread card numbers or confuse similar-looking Pokemon. A quick sanity check saves headaches later.\\n\\nSo this just allows you to iterate quickly. E.g. if you see that it got the wrong Pokemon, or that the card is not a Holo you can quickly rectify it here.\\n\\nOnce this is confirmed we export this as a raw CSV file.\\n\\n### Step 4: Visual Verification Grid\\n\\nHere\'s where it gets interesting.\\n\\nClaude Code downloads the official card image for each identified card from [pokemontcg.io](https://pokemontcg.io/). To do this, we need to map set names to their API codes - \\"Base Set\\" \u2192 base1, \\"Twilight Masquerade\\" \u2192 sv6.\\n\\nI built a lookup table covering 100+ sets from 1999 to 2025.\\n\\nThen we use PIL (Pillow) to reconstruct the original layout - same rows, same columns. For instance `--layout 3,3,3` flag means 3 cards per row, 3 rows total.\\n\\nWe added this script to this specific SKILLS folder.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code_6.png\\" alt=\\"Visual verification script in Claude Code\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nI store images from each of the cards individually. But most importantly I reconstruct the layout so it\'s easy to compare with my eyes. Here\'s the resulting output:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code_7.png\\" alt=\\"Reconstructed card layout for verification\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nAs they match, I\'m confident in the identification. If something\'s off, I go back and fix the table before wasting time on wrong price lookups.\\n\\nWhy bother with this step? Two reasons:\\n\\n1. **Image quality varies wildly.** eBay photos are particularly bad - poor lighting, weird angles, reflections everywhere. The verification grid catches misidentifications before they become wrong prices.\\n\\n2. **Holos are hard.** Distinguishing between a regular card, a holo, and a reverse holo from a photo is genuinely difficult. The rainbow sheen doesn\'t always photograph well. Human verification catches these edge cases.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n### Step 5: Price Estimation\\n\\nWith double-verified card data, Claude Code fetches prices from [Pokellector.com](https://pokellector.com/), which aggregates six sources:\\n\\n- TCGPlayer\\n- Troll & Toad\\n- eBay\\n- Stop2Shop\\n- Collectors Cache\\n- CoolStuffInc\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nWe have another script file on our SKILLS folder that is responsible by this.\\n\\nHere\'s the catch: Pokellector is renders dynamically with JavaScript, so requests and BeautifulSoup alone didn\'t work. So I had to use Selenium with headless Chrome to:\\n\\n1. Search for a card\\n2. Navigate to the best match\\n3. Extract prices from all six sources\\n4. Capture reference URLs\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe result: a comprehensive price table with links to verify each price.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2026-01-06-building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code_8.png\\" alt=\\"Price estimation results\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## The Takeaway\\n\\nThrowing an image at a model and asking \\"what\'s this worth?\\" gives you unreliable results. But breaking the problem into discrete steps, adding human verification at key points, and constraining the model\'s data sources transforms it into something genuinely useful.\\n\\nUltimately, it boils down to \\"do you have this skillset?\\".\\n\\nAnd now you add skills easily to your agents.\\n\\n## What\'s Next\\n\\nA few ideas of what could be done:\\n\\n- **eBay URL scraping:** Instead of manually saving photos, provide an eBay listing URL. The tool would scrape the images, run the identification workflow, and tell you if the listing is underpriced.\\n\\n- **Interface:** Right now this runs as a Claude Code skill. A dedicated website with lower latency and a cleaner UX would make it more accessible.\\n\\n- **Batch processing:** For larger collections, process multiple binder pages in sequence and aggregate the results.\\n\\n- **Condition grading:** Card condition dramatically affects value. Integrating some form of condition assessment (even a rough one) would improve accuracy."},{"id":"podcast-takeover","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/podcast-takeover","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-12-30-podcast-takeover.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-30-podcast-takeover.md","title":"Podcast takeover","description":"A list of my favorite podcasts from 2025.","date":"2025-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"podcasts","permalink":"/blog/tags/podcasts"},{"inline":true,"label":"learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/learning"},{"inline":true,"label":"recommendations","permalink":"/blog/tags/recommendations"}],"readingTime":10.51,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"podcast-takeover","title":"Podcast takeover","date":"2025-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-12-30-podcast-takeover","tags":["podcasts","learning","recommendations"],"description":"A list of my favorite podcasts from 2025.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Building a Pokemon Card Price Estimator with Claude Code","permalink":"/blog/building-a-pokemon-card-price-estimator-with-claude-code"},"nextItem":{"title":"I built a Claude Skill that turns podcasts into shareable clips","permalink":"/blog/i-built-a-claude-skill-that-turns-podcasts-into-shareable-clips"}},"content":"A list of my favorite podcasts from 2025.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFor the last couple of years I\'ve been reading more and more books...\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-30-podcast-takeover_1.png\\" alt=\\"Books tracking screenshot\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nI keep track of my books read (and to read) in my website [here](/books/already-read).\\n\\nRecently though, I\'ve spent a great deal of time listening to podcasts.\\n\\nI used to say I preferred books because they take months to produce, and by the time someone recommends one to me, there are thousands of reviews on it. So in a way, a book is not only carefully reviewed by the publisher but also vetted by thousands of readers.\\n\\nAnother thing: most books I read, startup stories, founder biographies, culture, ways of living, are timeless. If I read them today or in 10 years, they\'re just as valuable. This is a feature. It\'s also why authors spend so much time writing them in the first place. They know the ideas will echo for years to come.\\n\\nPodcasts, on the other hand, are a thing of the moment. Hosts don\'t think as heavily about what they say, at least not to the extent authors do with a book.\\n\\nBut with that comes a more unfiltered glimpse of personality. You also get nuggets of wisdom that are actually relevant *right now*, since most podcasts I listen to are about the current state of the world.\\n\\nThink of it as a simple 2x2: Is the topic timeless or timely? Has it already been deeply examined, or is it still unfolding? Books win for the former. Podcasts win for the latter.\\n\\nSo there are merits in both, and as a result I\'ve been enjoying spending a lot of time in podcasts.\\n\\nWith that said, I\'ve listened to over 20 different podcasts and while I don\'t religiously consume one in particular (ok, I do that with Acquired) - I tend to see them based on the episodes that get more traction on social media and my mood tbh.\\n\\nHere\'s my list of favorites (and a recommended episode on each), with some organization:\\n\\n## 1.

Attending conferences isn\'t enough. Reading about it isn\'t enough. You need to build something, and you\'re better off when you have a real problem to solve.\\n\\nHere was mine: I listen to a lot of podcasts. They\'re full of incredible nuggets I want to share, but nobody wants a link to a 90-minute episode with \\"trust me, minute 47 is awesome.\\" I\'d tried various clipping tools - paid ones with watermarks, free ones that were painful, even Claude Code with a lot of back-and-forth. Nothing worked in one shot.\\n\\nThen I thought about my friend Jordi Visser (ex-CIO of Weiss Multi-Strategy), who produces a [weekly macro podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgUnl5agSmw) essentially on his own. There\'s so much shareable content in his episodes that never gets extracted. I wanted to build something he could use too.\\n\\nSkills seemed like the right abstraction. I knew Claude Code *could* do this after enough iteration, but with Skills, I could package deterministic tools the agent could use off the shelf.\\n\\n## The approach: INPUT to OUTPUT first\\n\\nAt the start of any project, I bridge INPUT to OUTPUT at a high level. Make sure the connection works, then double down on everything in between.\\n\\n**Inputs:**\\n\\n- Video URL (*required*)\\n- Number of clips, min/max duration, specific focus areas (*optional*)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**Outputs (one folder per clip):**\\n\\n- `metadata.json` \u2014 clip title, start/end times, selection rationale\\n- `transcript.txt` \u2014 ready to copy-paste\\n- `clip.mp4` \u2014 ready to share\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n## 1. Make it work\\n\\nFirst goal: make it work in one shot. A single prompt like \\"get 3 clips under 2 minutes from this URL\\" should produce three folders with all the outputs.\\n\\nI gave Claude Code the input/output spec, a rough workflow, the [Skills documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills), and a [reference Skill that uses YouTube](https://github.com/michalparkola/tapestry-skills-for-claude-code/blob/main/youtube-transcript/SKILL.md).\\n\\nIt started with a PRD we agreed on, then converted it into a Skill. I gave it a URL. It worked.\\n\\nBut it was **rough around the edges**.\\n\\n## 2. Make it good\\n\\n\\"Good\\" depends on perspective. You acquire taste by using many products and noticing what separates good from bad experiences. Since I was my own end user, I could iterate fast.\\n\\nI tried different use cases - e.g.:\\n\\n- Get me 3 clips under 2 minutes\\n- Grab the clip about the AI bubble and startup valuations\\n- Get the 1 most controversial take of this podcast\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nA few things I noticed and fixed:\\n\\n- The transcript needed polish for easy copy-paste to X\\n- The transcript missed some text that showed up in the video\\n- Clips needed subtitles (I often watch without sound)\\n- Metadata was too sparse - I added the video URL with timestamp and the reasoning behind clip selection (insight, controversy, engagement potential)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nI kept iterating until I was happy, then asked Claude to update the Skill based on our final workflow.\\n\\n## 3. Make it fast\\n\\nEverything worked well now. But it was slow.\\n\\nThe bottleneck: Claude Code only had the Skill markdown prompt. Every script and command was being created on the fly.\\n\\nSo I added pre-built Python tools to my Skills folder. Instead of reasoning through script creation every time, the agent could execute tools directly. In one case, it even created a CLI with configurable arguments.\\n\\n## Why Skills are a weird and powerful abstraction\\n\\nSkills aren\'t just prompts, but they\'re also not as complex as building a sub-agent.\\n\\nI considered writing a Python CLI myself - let an AI model pick start/end times and be done with it. But that only works if I can one-shot my use case. What happens when I want \\"shift the window by 20 seconds\\" or \\"find similar topics across these five videos\\"?\\n\\nSkills keep the workflow open-ended. The agent can traverse the tooling universe and pick whatever\'s needed to get the job done.\\n\\nThis is what made the experience strange: I was watching the agent execute commands, create scripts, and build a more deterministic Python tool for downloading YouTube videos - all things I would have done myself, but it would have taken me a day. The agent was churning them out on the fly.\\n\\nAnd I could iterate alongside it.\\n\\nI can see where this is going. You have a conversation with Claude where you figure out a workflow through iteration. Then you say: \\"now turn this into a Skill\\".\\n\\nIt\'s not that different from human memory, when you do something, you learn how to do it.\\n\\n**Except in this case, I can add skills from other humans/agents to my toolset.**\\n\\nIncredible times ahead.\\n\\n## How to use it\\n\\n### Step 0: Set up Claude Code\\n\\n[Set up Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/getting-started) - Install, authenticate, and start using Claude Code on your development machine.\\n\\nOr make sure you update it with\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code\\n```\\n\\n### Step 1: Run CC\\n\\n```bash\\nclaude\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Install the get-y2b-clips plugin\\n\\nRun:\\n\\n```bash\\n/plugin\\n```\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-22-i-built-a-claude-skill-that-turns-podcasts-into-shareable-clips_1.png\\" alt=\\"Plugin command in Claude Code\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nClick \\"Add Marketplace\\" and add **DidierRLopes/get-y2b-clips**\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-22-i-built-a-claude-skill-that-turns-podcasts-into-shareable-clips_2.png\\" alt=\\"Add Marketplace dialog\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThen go into Marketplaces tab again and click on it.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-22-i-built-a-claude-skill-that-turns-podcasts-into-shareable-clips_3.png\\" alt=\\"Marketplace tab\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThen select one of the \\"Install\\" options.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-22-i-built-a-claude-skill-that-turns-podcasts-into-shareable-clips_4.png\\" alt=\\"Install options\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nAnd finally you will have this skill installed\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-22-i-built-a-claude-skill-that-turns-podcasts-into-shareable-clips_5.png\\" alt=\\"Skill installed confirmation\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Step 3: Try it out\\n\\n> Use get-y2b-clips on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps8PQOryRSU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps8PQOryRSU) to get one clip from Jordi talking about Gavin Baker\'s interview with Patrick O\'Shaughnessy and then another clip that is no more than 1m30s long that is the most controversial take from Jordi in the entire video.\\n\\n<p style={{fontSize: \'0.85em\'}}>Prompt I used to trigger my get-y2b-clips skill on CC</p>\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-22-i-built-a-claude-skill-that-turns-podcasts-into-shareable-clips_6.png\\" alt=\\"Prompt I used to trigger my get-y2b-clips skill on CC\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nHere\'s one of the outputs: [https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/2002746090408333635](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/2002746090408333635)\\n\\n## Open source code\\n\\n[GitHub - DidierRLopes/get-y2b-clips](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/get-y2b-clips): YouTube nuggets extraction via Claude Code Skill"},{"id":"the-bitter-lesson-of-context-metadata","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-bitter-lesson-of-context-metadata","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-12-17-the-bitter-lesson-of-context-metadata.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-17-the-bitter-lesson-of-context-metadata.md","title":"The bitter lesson of context metadata","description":"Stop adding business logic to your datasets","date":"2025-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"data","permalink":"/blog/tags/data"},{"inline":true,"label":"metadata","permalink":"/blog/tags/metadata"},{"inline":true,"label":"agents","permalink":"/blog/tags/agents"},{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/finance"}],"readingTime":6.18,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-bitter-lesson-of-context-metadata","title":"The bitter lesson of context metadata","date":"2025-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-12-17-the-bitter-lesson-of-context-metadata","tags":["ai","data","metadata","agents","openbb","finance"],"description":"Stop adding business logic to your datasets","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"I built a Claude Skill that turns podcasts into shareable clips","permalink":"/blog/i-built-a-claude-skill-that-turns-podcasts-into-shareable-clips"},"nextItem":{"title":"Your AI team isn\'t doing AI.

Most obsess over it, adding elaborate contextual metadata to every dataset. The experienced devs come full circle: they use minimal metadata too.\\n\\n**Less is more, and let me tell you why.**\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-17-the-bitter-lesson-of-context-metadata_1.png\\" alt=\\"IQ curve showing beginners and experts both using minimal metadata\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## Why more metadata limits your agent potential\\n\\nWalk into most financial firms today and you\'ll find data teams frantically enriching datasets with contextual metadata. They think they\'re being helpful.\\n\\nA news headlines dataset gets annotated: *\\"Market-moving financial news optimized for sentiment analysis. Pre-filtered for sentiment-bearing language. Link to ticker symbols for trading signals. Cross-reference with earnings calendar for event-driven analysis.\\"*\\n\\nEarnings call transcripts get tagged: *\\"Management commentary for fundamental analysis. Extract forward guidance and compare to analyst estimates. Score management tone for confidence signals. Primary source for qualitative assessment.\\"*\\n\\nThis looks sophisticated, but it\'s actually not a good idea.\\n\\nThe core mistake: **you\'re baking business logic into data.**\\n\\nFirst, **you\'re overfitting to known use cases.** That news dataset \\"optimized for sentiment analysis\\"? You\'ve just made it miss using that data for regulatory monitoring, compliance tracking, thematic research, and portfolio rebalancing workflows. The same data could serve a dozen purposes, but your metadata has steered agent for a specific singular-purpose use case.\\n\\nA risk team wants to scan headlines for regulatory announcements. A compliance officer needs disclosure triggers. A thematic analyst is tracking industry narratives. But your metadata keeps screaming \\"this is sentiment data for trading\\". You\'re actually constraining the value of this data.\\n\\nSecond, **your metadata may evolve over time.** Business logic changes. Market structure evolves. New workflows appear. That elaborate context metadata you wrote? It\'s no longer valid, steering people away from valid uses because the documentation says the data is \\"for\\" something else.\\n\\nStatic annotations can\'t keep up with dynamic needs. Every time you write \\"this dataset enables alpha generation through sentiment extraction\\", you\'re limiting the true potential of this dataset.\\n\\nThird, and this is the big one, **you\'re lobotomizing your agents.** You hired intelligent AI systems to reason about data, then you pre-decided how they should think about it. You\'ve stolen the reasoning step and replaced it with instructions.\\n\\nIt\'s like hiring a chess grandmaster and handing them a playbook of pre-approved moves. The whole point of having a grandmaster is that they can see combinations you can\'t.\\n\\n**But you\'ve constrained them to patterns you already know.**\\n\\nWhen you tell an agent \\"this news data is for sentiment analysis, join it with market data on tickers, use it to predict price movements\\", you\'ve eliminated the agent\'s ability to discover that the same data could reveal regulatory risk, identify sector rotation, or flag portfolio rebalancing triggers.\\n\\n**Every line of business context you add is a constraint you\'re imposing on future intelligence.**\\n\\nAnd here\'s what really matters in finance: **alpha doesn\'t live in individual datasets**. It emerges at intersections, when you combine datasets in non-obvious ways. A news headline alone tells you something happened. The insight comes when you overlay market data, options flow, portfolio holdings, sector performance, and historical patterns.\\n\\nBut if you\'ve pre-decided how each dataset should be used, you\'ve pre-decided which intersections are \\"valid\\". You\'ve turned your data infrastructure into a map with pre-drawn routes, when the whole point of intelligent agents is that they can discover new paths.\\n\\n## The sophisticated answer: Do almost nothing\\n\\nSo what should you actually do?\\n\\n**Keep datasets brutally minimal.**\\n\\nStructural metadata only:\\n\\n- Schema (what columns exist)\\n- Data types (string, integer, timestamp)\\n- Lineage (where this came from)\\n- Update frequency (how fresh it is)\\n- Provenance (who owns it)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThat\'s it. No business definitions. No use case documentation. No \\"this data is for X analysis\\" guidance. No elaborate context about what the data \\"means\\" or \\"enables\\".\\n\\nJust clean, structural information that describes the data technically without telling anyone how to think about it.\\n\\n**Let the data be dumb. Let the agent be smart.**\\n\\nHere\'s what this looks like in practice. Take those earnings call transcripts. Instead of pre-annotating them with business logic, you provide minimal metadata: timestamp, company identifier, speaker labels, transcript text. Clean structure, zero interpretation.\\n\\nNow an advanced agent needs to build a fundamental analysis model. It doesn\'t read your instructions. It reasons:\\n\\n*\\"I\'m validating management guidance. Transcripts contain forward-looking statements that need verification. I\'ll extract revenue and margin guidance from management remarks, pull analyst consensus from estimation databases, grab actual results from next quarter\'s financials, and check insider trading activity around the call date. If management\'s confidence doesn\'t align with their personal trading behavior, that\'s a signal. If guidance consistently diverges from results, that\'s another signal\\".*\\n\\nNobody told it to combine transcripts + estimates + actuals + insider trades. It understood the analytical goal and reasoned about which data combinations would answer it.\\n\\nThat\'s the difference. Pre-written metadata tells agents how data *has been* used. Agent intelligence figures out how it *can be* used.\\n\\nAnd this is why minimal metadata wins: **maximum flexibility equals maximum value.**\\n\\nThe same earnings transcript can serve fundamental analysis, sentiment modeling, thematic research, competitive intelligence, and risk assessment. All without conflicting metadata pulling in different directions. Each workflow gets what it needs because the agent reasons about combinations dynamically, not because someone documented every possible use case upfront.\\n\\nContext isn\'t pre-written in documentation. It\'s computed at runtime based on goals.\\n\\nAgents adapt to novel situations, discover unexpected data combinations, and avoid the maintenance burden of outdated annotations. Most importantly: they find alpha at intersections you didn\'t anticipate, because you haven\'t told them which intersections are \\"allowed\\".\\n\\n## Less is more\\n\\nIf you\'re enriching datasets with elaborate contextual metadata, stop. You\'re building at the wrong layer.\\n\\n**The practical shift:**\\n\\n**Stop:** Adding business logic to datasets. Documenting use cases in metadata. Pre-deciding how data should be combined. Trying to make datasets \\"self-explanatory\\" with context.\\n\\n**Start:** Keeping datasets structurally clean. Building agent intelligence that reasons about combinations. Trusting AI to figure out context based on goals.\\n\\nAt OpenBB, we\'ve designed around this philosophy. Users select which widget metadata gets exposed to agents - they control what context is available rather than inheriting someone else\'s assumptions. More importantly, users build their own agents and integrate them into their workspace, defining context based on what actually matters for their specific workflows. The agents aren\'t reading generic dataset descriptions. They\'re reasoning within user-defined contexts about which data to combine and why.\\n\\nThis is the shift: from data teams trying to predict every use case, to agents defining context dynamically based on actual work.\\n\\n**Both extremes of the IQ curve arrive at minimal metadata. One by accident, they never thought about it. One by design, they understand that intelligence lives in agents, not annotations.**\\n\\nThe difference between them? Knowing that context is a property of use, not data. That flexibility beats comprehensiveness. That the smartest datasets are the most generic.\\n\\n**The smartest thing you can do with your data is almost nothing.**\\n\\nStop over-engineering.\\n\\nStart trusting your AI.\\n\\nLess is more."},{"id":"your-ai-team-isnt-doing-ai-theyre-rebuilding-infrastructure","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/your-ai-team-isnt-doing-ai-theyre-rebuilding-infrastructure","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-12-09-your-ai-team-isnt-doing-ai-theyre-rebuilding-infrastructure.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-09-your-ai-team-isnt-doing-ai-theyre-rebuilding-infrastructure.md","title":"Your AI team isn\'t doing AI.

Someone on your team builds a Streamlit chatbot over a weekend. They feed it your research documents, hook it up to OpenAI, and boom \u2013 it works.\\n\\nIt actually works. You demo it to leadership. Everyone gets excited.\\n\\n*\\"This is it. This is our AI system.\\"*\\n\\n**Except that it isn\'t.**\\n\\nSix months later, you realize that the weekend POC is nothing like what you actually need. Context management doesn\'t work at scale. The AI hallucinates in production. It can\'t handle complex workflows. Data security is a nightmare. You don\'t have audit trails. And your best engineers? They\'re still in the weeds, wiring APIs, debugging context windows, building data pipelines, handling compliance requirements. They\'re not doing AI innovation. They\'re stuck doing foundational infrastructure work that every other firm is also doing.\\n\\nAnd guess what?\\n\\nOur OpenBB Copilot started exactly like that. But that was more than 2 years ago.\\n\\nDon\'t believe me? Look at this demo in December 2023, where we already had an AI chatbot integrated with the workspace that was able to handle structured and unstructured data.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1rYmWWVbIY\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe difference?\\n\\nWe didn\'t stop there. We spent the next years, and a couple of $M in R&D, learning what it actually takes to go from \\"fun experiment\\" to \\"production system that financial teams can trust\\".\\n\\nWe learned the hard way what a CTO actually needs when you\'re operating at scale: sophisticated context management, proper data governance, audit trails, security that doesn\'t compromise workflow, AI that\'s genuinely agentic and not just chatty.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-09-your-ai-team-isnt-doing-ai-theyre-rebuilding-infrastructure_1.png\\" alt=\\"7 level context layers slide from training workshop\\" />\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\"center\\" style={{fontSize: \'0.85em\', marginTop: \'-0.5em\'}}>Slide from our training workshop deck that shows the 7 level of context layers that the agent has to navigate, with each of these layers having sometimes hundreds to thousands of datasets.</p>\\n\\n## The foundation problem\\n\\nMost teams approach AI the same way: start from zero, wire together APIs, paste some prompt engineering on top, and hope it scales. This works until it doesn\'t. You\'re managing context windows, debugging agent hallucinations, building retrieval pipelines, handling data governance, integrating with proprietary systems - essentially rebuilding the same foundational plumbing that hundreds of other firms are also rebuilding in parallel.\\n\\nIt\'s a massive waste of engineering effort.\\n\\nGetting from \\"ChatGPT chatbot\\" to \\"production AI system that actually works\\" takes 24+ months of serious engineering work. Most teams don\'t have that. More importantly, your best quants and engineers get pulled away from high-value work, actual research, trading strategy, portfolio analysis, to build foundational infrastructure.\\n\\nThat\'s not an investment; it\'s opportunity cost.\\n\\nEvery month your top engineers spend on plumbing is a month they\'re not generating alpha or building your competitive advantage.\\n\\nI think there\'s a better way.\\n\\n## What we\'re offering enterprise clients\\n\\nFor our largest enterprise clients (above a certain seat count or contract size), we\'re providing source-available access to OpenBB Copilot. This is our AI system - the one we\'ve spent over two years and a couple of $M in R&D building.\\n\\nYou get the code. You get the architecture. You get two years of hard-earned lessons about what actually works in production.\\n\\nHere\'s what that means in practice:\\n\\n### 1. You skip the 24-month foundational build\\n\\nInstead of your team spending the next two years reinventing context management, agentic patterns (e.g. RAG), output validation, reasoning, citations, structured with unstructured data, URLs, MCPs, and data governance, they get a proven system from day one.\\n\\nThey can inspect the code, understand the design decisions, and extend it for your specific use cases. That\'s 24 months of engineering time you just reclaimed.\\n\\n### 2. You get a system built for real-world investment workflows\\n\\nCopilot wasn\'t designed in a lab - it was built to handle actual problems: connecting to multiple data sources, maintaining context across complex reasoning chains, enforcing data entitlements, handling compliance requirements, producing outputs that fit into real decision-making.\\n\\nThe architecture treats AI as a first-class component of a workflow, not a chatbot afterthought. Features like sophisticated context management (understanding which data sources matter most), dynamic widget parameter modification (automatically adjusting queries based on your needs), step-by-step reasoning visibility (so you can audit how the AI arrived at answers) and citations (even at the document sentence level) make the difference between a toy and a tool you can actually trust.\\n\\n### 3. You can customize and own it\\n\\nBecause you have source access, you\'re not locked into our roadmap or dependent on our support schedule. Your team can extend it, integrate it with proprietary systems, swap out models, add your own data sources \u2013 whatever your strategy requires.\\n\\nYou build your secret sauce on top of a solid foundation instead of building the foundation itself.\\n\\nDamn, you can even rebrand it internally to \\"Not OpenBB agent\\".\\n\\n### 4. You\'re not starting from zero on security and governance\\n\\nEnterprise AI is risky. Data leaks, compliance violations, audit trails - this stuff matters. Copilot was built with the workspace enterprise requirements from day one: on-prem deployment options, SSO, role-based access control, SOC2 compliance, proper data entitlement enforcement. Your team isn\'t reinventing the security wheel; they\'re extending a system that was built to be secure.\\n\\n### 5. Out-of-the-box financial environment designed for it to thrive\\n\\nHere\'s what most AI companies miss: a copilot is only as good as the environment it operates in. Copilot doesn\'t sit in isolation. It lives inside OpenBB Workspace, a purpose-built financial analysis platform with sophisticated context management, dynamic widget systems, parameter linking across dashboards, and native integration with your proprietary data sources.\\n\\nThis means Copilot understands the structure of your analysis \u2013 which data matters, which widgets are active, what parameters your team is using.\\n\\nIt\'s not just a chatbot bolted onto a generic system. It\'s an AI agent that\'s designed to orchestrate across your entire analytical environment. Your team gets access to the full capability stack: visualization, data integration, workflow automation, and AI reasoning - all built to work together.\\n\\n## Why this is the best bootstrap available\\n\\nThe core insight is simple: you can\'t innovate on the foundation while you\'re building it. Your best engineers get stuck doing plumbing. Your timeline stretches. Your cost balloons. And by the time you finish, the market has moved on.\\n\\nWith source-available access to Copilot, your team can start from a foundation that\'s already been battle-tested by real investors and quants using it in production. They can focus on what makes your firm different: your data, your workflows, your intellectual property - instead of rebuilding what every other firm is also rebuilding.\\n\\nBut there\'s another advantage: OpenBB continues investing heavily in the foundational layer of Copilot (and workspace).\\n\\nWe\'re pouring capital into making it better, faster, and smarter - exactly as we have for over two years.\\n\\nThat ongoing investment benefits you directly. Your team gets access to improvements, new capabilities, and deeper financial domain understanding without having to fund the R&D themselves.\\n\\nAnd because we\'re working across multiple firms and use cases, we\'re continuously learning what financial teams actually need to get done - which means the platform evolves with the industry, not in isolation. **For instance, we were the first workspace to support MCP server integration.**\\n\\nThis is how AI actually succeeds at investment firms: not by buying a generic tool, not by building from scratch, but by starting with proven infrastructure and layering their own innovation on top.\\n\\nThe firms that move fastest aren\'t the ones with the biggest budgets for AI, **they\'re the ones that don\'t waste their budgets on foundational problems that have already been solved.**\\n\\nSource-available Copilot is that solve.\\n\\nYour team gets over two years of R&D and a production-grade system. They focus on making it uniquely valuable for your investment process.\\n\\nEveryone wins.\\n\\nThe question isn\'t whether your firm will use AI - it\'s whether you\'ll spend the next 24 months building what already exists, or the next 24 months actually innovating with it.\\n\\nPS: Last week I shared an open source agent that I built over a weekend, our copilot is that + years of hard work.

New models drop constantly, but testing them with financial data requires jumping between platforms\\n2. OpenBB has all the financial data infrastructure, but no easy way to experiment with different LLM backends\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nSo I built something that solves both.\\n\\nBefore we start, here\'s the entire agent code fully open source: [https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-open-router-agent](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-open-router-agent)\\n\\n## What OSOR Agent Does\\n\\nOSOR Agent combines OpenBB\'s data & infra layer with Open Router\'s model flexibility.\\n\\nHere\'s what that actually means:\\n\\n### Pick Any Model, Anytime\\n\\nOpen Router gives you access to hundreds of models - Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Grok, open-source models.\\n\\nSome are literally free, like Grok 4.1 Fast (as of Nov\' 23).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-02-introducing-osor-agent_1.png\\" alt=\\"Open Router model selection showing free models\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nWhen a new model drops, you just select it. No new account, no new interface.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-02-introducing-osor-agent_2.png\\" alt=\\"Model selection dropdown in OSOR Agent\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Mature AI Chatting Interface\\n\\nInstead of copy-pasting financial data around, the agent pulls directly from OpenBB widgets. Your market data, portfolio metrics, news, whatever you\'ve connected to your workspace, feeds directly into the LLM context.\\n\\nYou can also expand AI chat so the remainder of the dashboard disappears.\\n\\nIt even has access to data via MCP as you can see below, and shares its internal step by step reasoning!\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-02-introducing-osor-agent_3.png\\" alt=\\"OSOR Agent showing step by step reasoning with MCP data\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Your Agentic Financial Workspace\\n\\nThe agent can generate charts, tables, and citations so you\'re not just reading wall-of-text responses. It understands your data structure and responds accordingly.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-02-introducing-osor-agent_4.png\\" alt=\\"OSOR Agent generating charts and tables\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nIn my opinion, you shouldn\'t have to choose between testing the latest AI model and having access to your financial data.\\n\\nYou shouldn\'t have to manually move data around.\\n\\nYou shouldn\'t have to become an expert in multiple platforms.\\n\\nOSOR Agent is small, but the principle is big. It treats data access like infrastructure - get it right once, then let people experiment freely on top of it.\\n\\n## Open Source\\n\\nThe full code is MIT licensed and open source.\\n\\nThat means you can fork it, extend it, build whatever you want on top of it. Want to add RAG underneath? Build it. Want custom analysis for a specific strategy? Build it.\\n\\nThe best models are worthless without access to data that matters.\\n\\nOSOR Agent is a step in that direction on top of a mature financial workspace, OpenBB Workspace.\\n\\n### This is a Starting Point\\n\\nThere\'s a lot that can be done to improve the agent, this was a weekend project built on top of our vanilla agent examples [https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/agents-for-openbb](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/agents-for-openbb)\\n\\nHere\'s an example of the agent powered by Gemini 3 working with Top Events from Polymarket when asked about what events I should look at within the \\"FED\\" category.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-02-introducing-osor-agent_5.png\\" alt=\\"OSOR Agent with Polymarket FED events analysis\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-12-02-introducing-osor-agent_6.png\\" alt=\\"OSOR Agent detailed analysis of FED events\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nContributions are welcome, happy hacking! :)\\n\\n[https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-open-router-agent](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-open-router-agent)"},{"id":"the-rise-of-forward-deployed-engineering-in-finance","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-rise-of-forward-deployed-engineering-in-finance","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-11-25-the-rise-of-forward-deployed-engineering-in-finance.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-25-the-rise-of-forward-deployed-engineering-in-finance.md","title":"The rise of forward-deployed engineering in finance","description":"AI-native platforms promise to automate financial workflows, but enterprise wins aren\'t self-serve trials - they\'re proof-of-concepts plus forward-deployed engineers.","date":"2025-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/engineering"},{"inline":true,"label":"finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/finance"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"enterprise","permalink":"/blog/tags/enterprise"},{"inline":true,"label":"palantir","permalink":"/blog/tags/palantir"}],"readingTime":6.07,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-rise-of-forward-deployed-engineering-in-finance","title":"The rise of forward-deployed engineering in finance","date":"2025-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-11-25-the-rise-of-forward-deployed-engineering-in-finance","tags":["engineering","finance","ai","enterprise","palantir"],"description":"AI-native platforms promise to automate financial workflows, but enterprise wins aren\'t self-serve trials - they\'re proof-of-concepts plus forward-deployed engineers.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Introducing OSOR Agent","permalink":"/blog/introducing-osor-agent"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why generative AI isn\'t uncovering alpha yet","permalink":"/blog/why-generative-ai-isnt-uncovering-alpha-yet"}},"content":"A few weeks ago, we were at the HQ of one of our largest clients (close to 70bn AUM) for a week and although I had this post in draft for a couple of months, these words resonate even more with me now as we experienced this FDE work first-hand.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![Team at client HQ](/blog/2025-11-25-the-rise-of-forward-deployed-engineering-in-finance_1.png)\\n\\nAnyway, let\'s talk about FDE.\\n\\nLet me start by sharing an excerpt by Palantir\'s CTO on the origin of the name \\"_Forward Deployed Engineer_\\" and how it relates to how French restaurants works.\\n\\n> In 2006, Alex Karp asked me if I knew why French restaurants were so good. I had no idea. He told me that at a French restaurant, the wait staff is actually part of the kitchen staff. They intimately understand the food, the methodology, and the technique. They are not merely carrying the food from the kitchen to the table, but are instead part of a subtle and complex system that affects kitchen operations. He wanted me to build that, but for engineering.\\n>\\n> <br />\\n>\\n> I did just that, and in 2007, I gave it the name \\"forward deployed engineering\\" (FDE) in homage to our customers. FDEs embed alongside our customers and work to ensure our software solves their problem and not some proxy for their problem. They\'re crazy enough to get on a last-minute plane to Iraq, they\'re smart enough to ship quality, same-day code, and their EQ is still high enough to talk to users (and maybe even enjoy it). Investors ridiculed us for creating a \\"services\\" role that would only serve to depress the margins of a software company. We didn\'t look like the other SaaS businesses, something they eventually realized was a feature, not a bug. Just like French restaurants don\'t blindly hand off food from an uninformed waiter to the diner, we didn\'t believe in throwing our software over the wall in the hopes the customer would divine the correct meaning from it. This approach built an engineering organization with unmatched creativity, responsiveness, and focus on the primacy of winning.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**Shyam Sankar (Palantir\'s CTO)** - [\\"The Primacy of Winning\\"](https://www.piratewires.com/p/primacy-of-winning-shyam-sankar-palantir)\\n\\n## The quiet truth\\n\\nAI-native platforms promise to \\"automate financial workflows\\". But enterprise wins aren\'t self-serve trials, they\'re proof-of-concepts plus forward-deployed engineers.\\n\\nEngineers sitting inside client offices. Writing code on their networks. Building bespoke workflows that prove the platform works.\\n\\nFor every \\"AI assistant for analysts\\", there are FDEs buried in a buy-side firm\'s infrastructure, understanding data pipelines, writing agentic workflows, fixing edge cases, etc\u2026 The companies landing the biggest customers aren\'t winning on product alone, they\'re winning on proximity.\\n\\nIn finance, no abstraction replaces trust. This isn\'t a workaround. It\'s how intelligence software gets deployed in high-stakes domains.\\n\\n## Why forward deployment works\\n\\nAI-native software isn\'t plug-and-play. Output quality depends on data specificity and governance. Every firm\'s architecture is different. Forward deployment brings engineering to the data.\\n\\nAn embedded engineer does three things pure software can\'t:\\n\\n1. **Translates domain into system.** They learn how the firm defines \\"exposure\\" or \\"active position\\" and encode those meanings into their workflows.\\n\\n2. **Builds trust loops.** Same Slack channels, real workflows, outputs validated against the firm\'s sources of truth.\\n\\n3. **Turns deployments into reusable abstractions.** Each new workflow becomes productized logic that can be leveraged for the next client.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nMost AI companies say they\'re selling intelligence. They\'re selling trust. Clients ask what peers are doing. They want the playbook, not just the platform. An engineer inside the firm, fixing pipelines and aligning definitions, builds credibility no deck can.\\n\\nTrust compounds. Every successful deployment becomes a reference pattern the engineer can leverage for next client, obviously without sharing the actual workflow.\\n\\n## The Palantir playbook\\n\\nThe breakthrough wasn\'t \\"work closely with clients\\". It was turning embedded work into product leverage.\\n\\nEach deployment as live R&D. Engineers discovered reusable patterns: data models, workflows, connectors, ontologies. Those patterns moved into the platform, so the next deployment started smarter.\\n\\nThe self-scaling loop:\\n\\n- Engineers deploy \u2192 deployment creates insight \u2192 insight becomes reusable \u2192 product gets stronger \u2192 next deployment accelerates\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nWhat looked like high-touch work was the most scalable form of enterprise learning. Agentic finance is doing this now. Teams embedding engineers aren\'t slowing product - they\'re accelerating it.\\n\\nThis is the playbook for the agentic era: scale product by deploying where it\'s most complex. Learn fast, abstract faster.\\n\\n> (\u2026) Specifically, the firm [PLTR] provides a modern AI data platform (i.e., analytical tools, data infrastructure software, AI tooling) that helps government agencies and enterprises make data-driven decisions by detecting unusual or previously undetectable patterns in large complex datasets. Its AI data platform is differentiated by its Ontology, which presents data to users in their own everyday terms and represents decisions in an enterprise, thus becoming a powerful tool for AI-driven decision-making. On top of this, Palantir deploys an effective and super-efficient go-to-market approach that attracts customers and quickly converts them into paying customers of its complex products. (\u2026)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**Loop Capital\'s report on February 19th, 2025:** \\"Game-Changing Software Play Leading the Enterprise AI Revolution; Initiate Buy\\"\\n\\n## The hybrid flywheel\\n\\nPLG dominated the last decade because products were simple and users empowered to self-serve. AI-native finance breaks that logic, it\'s probabilistic, data-hungry, unpredictable in the wild.\\n\\nPLG still matters as half the story. Bottom-up motion builds credibility and reach. But PLG alone doesn\'t close institutional deals or integrate with legacy systems. In finance, analysts often lack the time or mandate to tinker.\\n\\nForward deployment closes those gaps, but can\'t scale in isolation. Without strong product underneath, every engagement risks becoming bespoke.\\n\\nThe future isn\'t product-led or sales-led. It\'s deployment-led growth, powered by a product that learns faster with every field engagement.\\n\\nHere\'s the loop:\\n\\n- **Open distribution** \u2192 rapid experimentation. Free tiers, open examples, extensible interfaces.\\n\\n- **FDEs** \u2192 institutional activation. Embedded engineers integrate, secure, productionize.\\n\\n- **Field learning** \u2192 product leverage. With every integration there are new teachings, that are folded back so the next deployment is faster.\\n\\n- **Faster deployments** \u2192 broader adoption. As the product gets smarter, less custom work is needed. The loop accelerates.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**Community fuels product. Product fuels deployment. Deployment fuels product again.**\\n\\n## One motion\\n\\nBottom-up and top-down are converging.\\n\\nThe open community and the forward-deployed engineer are two sides of one motion - one learns from scale, the other from proximity.

But recently, Ken Griffin, one of the industry\'s most respected voices, made a bold claim: generative AI isn\'t delivering alpha for hedge funds. Instead, it\'s mainly boosting workflows and productivity.\\n\\nHe\'s not entirely wrong but he\'s not telling the whole story either.\\n\\nHere\'s the thing: the problem isn\'t that AI lacks the capability to find alpha. The problem is that most firms aren\'t giving AI the environment it needs to succeed.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Breaking down Griffin\'s argument\\n\\nLet\'s start by acknowledging Griffin\'s point. He\'s correct that a lot of current AI use cases are indeed improving workflows rather than generating new market-beating insights.\\n\\nMany firms use AI to automate research summaries, streamline reporting, or speed up documentation reviews. These are valuable applications, no question. But they\'re fundamentally different from uncovering alpha.\\n\\nGriffin\'s observation reflects a real pattern in how firms are deploying generative AI today. They\'re thinking about AI first, then providing it with just enough data to complete a specific workflow. It\'s a narrow, task-focused approach.\\n\\nAnd within those constraints, AI is delivering exactly what you\'d expect: **incremental productivity gains**.\\n\\nSo Griffin isn\'t wrong. He\'s just incomplete.\\n\\nThe real root cause is\u2026\\n\\n\\n## Lack of integrated workspaces\\n\\nHere\'s where the narrative shifts: the reason AI isn\'t finding alpha isn\'t because AI can\'t find alpha.\\n\\n**It\'s because most firms aren\'t leaning in enough to give AI and the user what they actually need, a unified, collaborative workspace where all their data is fully accessible and integrated.**\\n\\nThink about where alpha traditionally comes from in hedge funds.\\n\\nIt emerges at the intersection of insights that no one else has connected yet. It lives in the correlations between datasets that were previously siloed. A trader might notice a pattern across private equity, public equities, and macro data that nobody has synthesized before. That\'s where edges come from.\\n\\nThat discovery process isn\'t meant to be a machine doing it alone in a black box. It\'s meant to be a conversation. An AI system that can surface patterns and ask \\"what if we looked at these datasets together?\\" while a human brings domain expertise, intuition, and judgment to interpret what those patterns actually mean for the investment thesis.\\n\\nMost firms today don\'t have that dynamic. They have fragmented data silos, which means the human and AI can\'t collaborate effectively. The data lives in separate platforms, the insights stay isolated, and neither the AI nor the human can see the full picture.\\n\\nIt\'s not a collaboration at all, it\'s a constraint.\\n\\nNow imagine if you could give an AI system access to all of that data simultaneously, in one integrated environment. Not just for the AI to analyze in isolation, but as a true workspace where the AI and human can work together.\\n\\nThe AI could surface patterns across asset classes, teams, and time periods that humans might miss. It could ask questions like \\"have we ever seen these two metrics move together?\\" or \\"what happens when these conditions align?\\" And then a skilled analyst or trader could jump in with context, ask follow-up questions, and develop those insights into real alpha.\\n\\n**That\'s the collaboration model that actually works.**\\n\\nIt\'s not about replacing humans with AI. It\'s about giving both the human and the AI the environment they need to think together.\\n\\n*I did a small POC at the start of the year of where we are heading, and it\'s so clear to me that this is the future - watch this 50 second clip.*\\n\\n\\n## How a unified approach unlocks alpha at the intersection\\n\\nWhen all of a firm\'s data lives in one place, truly integrated and accessible, something powerful happens.\\n\\nThe AI and human can actually work together to surface patterns that would never emerge from siloed environments.\\n\\nConsider a concrete example: a firm brings together public market data, private market data, macroeconomic indicators, and alternative data sources all in one workspace. An analyst poses a question: \\"What correlations emerge when we combine private equity valuations with macro conditions and public market movements?\\" The AI agent analyzes this unified dataset and surfaces patterns. Maybe it discovers that certain private equity valuations tend to spike precisely when specific macro conditions align with particular public market movements. That insight might not be obvious if you\'re looking at those datasets separately. But at their intersection? That\'s alpha waiting to be explored.\\n\\nThe same principle applies across different teams and geographies. When portfolio managers, research analysts, and risk analysts can all feed their data into a shared workspace, the AI becomes a tool for collaborative discovery. It surfaces opportunities that emerge from combinations of perspectives that were previously isolated from each other.\\n\\nThis is why building a unified workspace where firms can bring their data in from different asset classes, different teams, and different geographies matters so much. It\'s not just about convenience or consolidation. It\'s about creating the conditions where humans and AI can collaborate effectively to discover alpha in the intersections where it actually lives.\\n\\nAnd here\'s something worth keeping in mind: the models are only getting better. They\'re getting smarter, handling more data, parsing more complexity. The ability to digest and understand massive, unified datasets is not a limitation of future AI, it\'s just a matter of time.\\n\\nThe firms that build these integrated workspaces today won\'t just get the competitive advantage from the tools available right now. **They\'ll be perfectly positioned to take advantage of the next generation of models that can do even more with all that data.**\\n\\n\\n## Addressing the real-world complexities\\n\\nAlthough I\'m biased, I want to be honest. A unified workspace is a powerful enabler, but it\'s not a magic wand. Finding alpha still requires the right strategies, the right people, and a willingness to experiment with new combinations of data.\\n\\nThere\'s also the matter of integration itself. Bringing all these datasets into one workspace isn\'t trivial. It requires effort, investment, and a willingness to rethink how data flows through the organization. For many firms, that\'s a significant lift.\\n\\nBut here\'s the thing: **the long-term payoff is worth it**. By bringing disparate datasets together and allowing AI to work alongside your team, firms can unlock insights that were previously hidden.\\n\\nThe firms that make this investment today, that build truly unified workspaces, will be the ones discovering alpha tomorrow while others are still wrestling with siloed data infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n## The path forward\\n\\nThe future of AI-driven alpha doesn\'t lie in deploying more AI to individual workflows. It lies in breaking down data silos and building integrated environments where AI can discover patterns at the intersection of datasets.\\n\\nA unified workspace is a critical piece of that puzzle, but it\'s part of a broader toolkit that also involves having the right people, the right strategies, and the right culture of experimentation. It requires firms to rethink their data strategies from the ground up but that shift is essential.\\n\\nThe invitation is clear: rethink how your data is organized.\\n\\nEmbrace integrated approaches.\\n\\nConsider how a unified workspace can transform AI from a productivity tool into a true source of competitive advantage.\\n\\nTruly imagine it.\\n\\nThe insights, and the alpha, are waiting at the intersections.\\n\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\n(Alex is also compiling a list of all AI startups in the financial space, which you can check out [here](https://alexizydorczyk.com/ai-for-hedge-funds.html))\\n\\nIf I were to segment companies, I would probably segment them as:\\n\\n1. **Data first companies** - Data Extraction Tools and AI Model Providers (Alpha, Quant, & Forecasting Labs). Selling signals, or derivative is still selling data, it\'s just - allegedly - more valuable data because it has been processed in a certain way that makes it more valuable. Competing with Bloomberg, S&P, FactSet, ...\\n\\n2. **AI first companies** - Research Copilots (AI \\"Analyst\\" Assistants) and Excel Copilots (Financial Modeling Aides). They start with AI first and then try to find data relevant to their customers. Competing with OpenAI, Anthropic, ...\\n\\n3. **Infrastructure first companies** - \\"Terminal 2.0\\" Platforms (Next-Gen Market Terminals). I think examples of the competition is Claude for Financial Services with their MCPs integrations or Blackrock\'s Aladdin with their new copilot. However, I think that this will always be limiting to create Alpha because if everyone has access to same data and intelligence, then it\'s hard to find alpha.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n### How it started\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-10-28-why-generative-ai-isnt-uncovering-alpha-yet_1.png\\" alt=\\"How it started - diagram showing traditional data flow\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### How it\'s going\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-10-28-why-generative-ai-isnt-uncovering-alpha-yet_2.png\\" alt=\\"How it\'s going - current state of AI implementation\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### The future\\n\\n\\"*If a strategy with a proven positive alpha becomes public information, its profitability is eroded through market efficiency.*\\"\\n\\nThen, Data + Intelligence needs to happen within organization.

Control over data, pricing, and how professionals accessed information. That control wasn\'t arbitrary - it was the logical outcome of incentives built around data margins rather than user outcomes.\\n\\nBut that control is eroding. The explosion of alternative data, the rise of AI agents, and the stubborn focus on selling data over serving users have created a fracture the old model can\'t contain.\\n\\nA new model is emerging: interface-first, data-neutral, and AI-native. A model where the software layer serves the user, not the vendor\'s data sales team. Where the interface becomes a true operating system for finance: open, modular, and intelligent.\\n\\nThe shift is structural. And it\'s being driven by the same forces that once built the terminal, an explosion of data, new forms of intelligence, and an industry that can no longer afford misaligned incentives.\\n\\n## The incentive flip\\n\\nFor decades, financial software bundled everything: the data, the tools, and the user experience. You paid one price for all of it - a package so tightly coupled that you could never separate what you were really paying for.\\n\\nThat bundle created an empire. But it also created a distortion. Vendors optimized for selling data, not for improving the user experience. Every design choice, from the limited export features to the lack of integration with external datasets, served the protection of data margins.\\n\\n**A decoupled interface breaks that dynamic.**\\n\\nOnce the UI stands on its own, its incentive flips. A standalone interface doesn\'t need to protect data entitlements. It only needs to serve the user. Its success depends on usability, speed, and how well it integrates with whatever the analyst already uses - not on how many internal datasets it can upsell.\\n\\nThe interface becomes an impartial workbench. Analysts can plug in their preferred data sources - proprietary, public, or alternative - and get to work without vendor interference. They stop paying for access to data they don\'t use and start paying for software that helps them move faster.\\n\\nThis separation forces competition where it matters most - speed, interoperability, and design - rather than who controls the data contracts. In a world where most professionals already subscribe to multiple feeds, the real value isn\'t in who sells the data. It\'s in who helps you make sense of it.\\n\\n## Why this moment\\n\\nFinance has always been data-driven. But today, it\'s data-saturated.\\n\\nSatellite imagery, credit card transactions, app usage, ESG disclosures, web traffic, social sentiment... New datasets are arriving faster than any incumbent can ingest them. Most of them don\'t fit neatly into a pre-built terminal. They\'re messy, dynamic, and often proprietary.\\n\\nNo closed platform can keep up with this level of diversity. The data landscape has simply outgrown the idea of a single vendor controlling the flow.\\n\\n**Closed systems once thrived on scarcity; open ones now thrive on abundance.**\\n\\nWhat\'s needed is an open interface, one built like a network. It should treat data as modular and composable, like APIs that can be plugged in and swapped out. Analysts should be able to connect to a new data source, build a model, or run an AI workflow without waiting for a vendor\'s permission.\\n\\nModern platforms embrace this modularity. They\'re designed as pipelines rather than products. They see finance as a system of moving parts - some internal, some external, all interoperable. The contrast with legacy systems is stark. A monolithic terminal moves slowly because it\'s built around the assumption of completeness: that everything you could ever need lives inside its walls. That assumption no longer holds.\\n\\n**Neutrality becomes a survival strategy, not a philosophy.**\\n\\nAn interface built for neutrality doesn\'t push one feed, model, or dataset over another; it simply exposes the best tools and lets the user decide. This is the opposite of the incentive structure that has dominated finance for decades. In the old world, every UI was also a distribution channel. Every search result, chart, and default setting subtly guided users toward in-house content.\\n\\nA neutral interface ends that. It competes not on exclusivity but on openness. Its job is to make the user\'s workflow faster, cleaner, and more powerful - not to shape what data they consume. When users can bring any data or tool they want, innovation moves faster. Vendors compete on quality rather than access, and analysts can finally mix the best of everything in one coherent environment. **Their coherent environment, shaped to their workflow.**\\n\\n## The architecture of openness\\n\\nIf you follow this logic to its conclusion, an open, extensible, AI-native interface becomes something larger than an app. **It becomes the operating system of finance.**\\n\\nLike a computer OS, it provides a unified environment for every tool, every dataset, every agent. In this world, an analyst doesn\'t open five different applications. They open the same workspace every morning, and it is their environment. It holds their context, connects to their data, and runs their automations & workflows.\\n\\nBuilding this requires solving three hard problems:\\n\\n**The data problem:** Ingesting structured and unstructured data at enterprise scale while maintaining governance and latency.\\n\\n**The interface problem:** Designing a UX flexible enough for research, analytics, and reporting without having the user leaving the platform.\\n\\n**The ecosystem problem:** Convincing vendors, users, and developers to build on top of it rather than around it.\\n\\nThat\'s why few have tried. And why those who do will define the next generation of financial software.\\n\\n### Extensibility: the expression of freedom\\n\\nModern analysts don\'t just consume data; they create it. Every model, notebook, and internal database is a new form of proprietary signal. A next-generation interface needs to treat that as first-class input.\\n\\n**Bring your own data.** Analysts can connect internal systems - their Snowflake warehouse, their portfolio data, or even unstructured files like research memos - and blend them seamlessly with vendor data. No conversions, no export limits, no awkward detours through Excel.\\n\\n**Bring your own agent.** The analyst can integrate their own intelligence layer. One day it might be a general-purpose LLM; the next, a fine-tuned model that excels at analyzing FOMC minutes. The interface shouldn\'t care. It should provide an open protocol for intelligence - where agents and tools can be orchestrated together without friction.\\n\\n**Bring your own workflow.** This is where data, models, and agents converge to automate complex, multi-step tasks - like drafting an investment memo, building a risk dashboard, or monitoring credit exposures. A workflow is no longer a hard-coded process inside a terminal; it\'s something the analyst defines. You might start with your firm\'s internal data, enrich it with a vendor\'s ESG feed, and pass both through an AI agent that writes the first draft of your memo - all within the same interface. The workflow can then route the output to a colleague for review, trigger an update in a dashboard, or feed the result into another model.\\n\\nExtensibility is no longer a technical feature, it\'s the expression of freedom inside the software.\\n\\n### Intelligence: context as currency\\n\\nAn AI-native interface isn\'t a chat window. It\'s an environment that understands context, remembers state, and reacts to changes. It\'s aware of your portfolio, your preferences, your recent queries, and even your compliance boundaries. It can reason across multiple data sources and agents - not by pretending to know everything, but by knowing how to connect to everything.\\n\\nIn this world, context becomes currency: the better your interface understands it, the smarter every workflow becomes.\\n\\nThis demands event-driven architecture. Legacy systems were designed around menus and files; AI-native systems are built around events and context. Every user interaction carries metadata: who asked, about what, under what constraints. Every answer links back to its provenance. The system becomes self-documenting - every step traceable, every output auditable.\\n\\nAnd because it\'s event-driven, it\'s always on. The interface doesn\'t wait for you to ask \\"what changed overnight?\\" - it tells you. It doesn\'t wait for you to open a chart, it updates it as new data arrives. The interface becomes a living environment. It evolves with you, learning from every query, refining context, and surfacing insights before you ask.\\n\\nThe shift to this financial software OS will move even faster with AI, not because AI is flashy, but because it turns the entire system into an alpha-generating machine. Every integrated data source becomes a signal. Every workflow becomes repeatable edge. The interface doesn\'t just help you find alpha; it compounds it.\\n\\n## Beyond hedge funds\\n\\nThis transformation isn\'t limited to the quant elite. It\'s spreading across the entire industry.\\n\\nEvery firm, from asset managers to corporate treasuries, now operates in a multi-data world. Analysts are technically literate, often fluent in Python, and increasingly empowered by AI. Non-developers can build small automations or workflows that once required entire IT teams. The power dynamic is shifting from vendor-driven tools to user-driven environments.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the open-source ecosystem has exploded. Powerful financial libraries, AI agents, and visualization frameworks are freely available. The infrastructure that once cost millions can now be assembled by a small team.\\n\\nThe monopoly of access has collapsed. Firms no longer want to rent the same interface as their competitors; they want to own their workflows. The transition won\'t be smooth. But the pattern is clear: openness outcompetes control. Modular systems outpace monoliths. And the users, now more empowered than ever, are driving the change themselves.\\n\\n## The path forward\\n\\nThe story of financial software has always been a story about control. Who controls the data, who controls the interface, who controls the user experience.\\n\\nThat control is now up for grabs.\\n\\nThe winners of the next era won\'t be those who hoard data, but those who make it usable. They\'ll build interfaces that adapt, not entrap. They\'ll align incentives with users, not against them.\\n\\nAnd they\'ll understand that a true financial OS isn\'t built in isolation, it\'s built in community.\\n\\nOpen ecosystems matter. A modern financial interface needs an open developer base to grow new connectors, agents, and applications organically. It needs users contributing back to the system, expanding its capabilities faster than any single company could.\\n\\nThis is exactly what we\'re building at OpenBB. An open, AI-native workspace that\'s data-neutral by design. A platform that integrates seamlessly with any dataset, any model, any agent. A financial operating system that\'s not owned by a data vendor, but powered by its users.\\n\\nSoon, we\'ll announce the [Open Data Platform](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB) which is the largest open source project in the finance category, proof that the appetite for neutrality, openness, and innovation is real. And as the ecosystem grows, every new connector, every new AI agent, every new app built by the community compounds the network effect.\\n\\nThe era of walled-garden financial software is ending.\\n\\nThe next generation of financial software won\'t sell you data, it will give you power.\\n\\n**The interface is striking back.**\\n\\nAnd this time, it\'s on the user\'s side."},{"id":"the-hidden-incentive-war-behind-financial-terminals","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-hidden-incentive-war-behind-financial-terminals","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-10-08-the-hidden-incentive-war-behind-financial-terminals.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-08-the-hidden-incentive-war-behind-financial-terminals.md","title":"The hidden incentive war behind financial terminals","description":"How the misalignment between data providers and interface builders creates friction for users - the hidden conflict between selling data and serving users in financial software.","date":"2025-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/finance"},{"inline":true,"label":"financial-terminals","permalink":"/blog/tags/financial-terminals"},{"inline":true,"label":"data","permalink":"/blog/tags/data"},{"inline":true,"label":"incentives","permalink":"/blog/tags/incentives"},{"inline":true,"label":"business-model","permalink":"/blog/tags/business-model"},{"inline":true,"label":"ux","permalink":"/blog/tags/ux"},{"inline":true,"label":"bloomberg","permalink":"/blog/tags/bloomberg"},{"inline":true,"label":"interfaces","permalink":"/blog/tags/interfaces"}],"readingTime":13.37,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-hidden-incentive-war-behind-financial-terminals","title":"The hidden incentive war behind financial terminals","date":"2025-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-10-08-the-hidden-incentive-war-behind-financial-terminals","tags":["finance","financial-terminals","data","incentives","business-model","ux","bloomberg","interfaces"],"description":"How the misalignment between data providers and interface builders creates friction for users - the hidden conflict between selling data and serving users in financial software.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Rethinking the financial interface in the age of data and intelligence abundance","permalink":"/blog/rethinking-the-financial-interface-in-the-age-of-data-and-intelligence-abundance"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Evolution of AI Agents in Finance","permalink":"/blog/the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-finance"}},"content":"![The hidden incentive war behind financial terminals](/blog/2025-10-08-the-hidden-incentive-war-behind-financial-terminals.png)\\n\\nHow the misalignment between data providers and interface builders creates friction for users - the hidden conflict between selling data and serving users in financial software.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nI\'ve spent years building and learning about financial software, and I\'ve come to understand how big of a misalignment there is between data providers and interface builders. In simpler terms, companies that sell financial data also build the software (workspaces, terminals, interfaces) that professionals use, but their goals for the data often clash with what users need from the interface.\\n\\nThis misalignment operates quietly behind the scenes, yet it affects everything from product features to user workflows. In this first part of a two-part series, I want to unpack this conflict from my perspective, to shed light on why these tools often feel clunky despite sky-high prices.\\n\\n## Why the all-in-one model made sense (until it didn\'t)\\n\\nTo understand why this gap runs so deep, it helps to look at how the current model came to be.\\n\\nA few decades ago, the \\"all-in-one terminal\\" was a brilliant solution to a real problem. Financial data was scarce, fragmented, and technically hard to distribute. Building a single platform that bundled real-time prices, analytics, chat, research, and trading in one environment was revolutionary. It created a flywheel: the more professionals used it, the more indispensable it became. Every new user made the network more valuable; every new data feed reinforced the platform\'s position.\\n\\nThat success baked in an assumption: the same company should own both the data and the interface. At the time, that made perfect sense. Integration guaranteed speed, consistency, and trust. Clients didn\'t want to juggle APIs; they wanted one screen where everything just worked. For decades, that was the winning formula, and the incentives were aligned, the vendor got paid for data, and the user got reliability.\\n\\nBut the world changed. Data exploded. APIs became cheap and ubiquitous. Firms started generating their own proprietary datasets, and new categories of alternative data - web traffic, satellite imagery, sentiment, transactions - appeared faster than any one vendor could absorb. The interface was no longer the bottleneck; the business model was.\\n\\nThe incumbents stayed optimized for the old equilibrium: control all the data, protect the margins, keep the user inside.\\n\\nThat\'s the problem. What was once an elegant way to simplify complexity has become a structural drag on innovation. The all-in-one design isn\'t broken because it\'s unified; it\'s broken because it\'s closed. Every decision about openness or interoperability now runs through the same filter: \\"Will this threaten our data revenue?\\"\\n\\nAt a high level, the data vendors are primarily optimized to protect and grow their data profit streams, while the ideal interface should be optimized to reduce user friction and empower workflow flexibility. These two priorities collide constantly. The result is interfaces that are frequently restricted or designed in ways that favor the vendor\'s bottom line over the user\'s experience.\\n\\n## How data vendors guard the golden goose\\n\\n### Act 1: What users see\\n\\nFinancial data is extremely lucrative. Major market data providers enjoy operating profit margins that tech-only product companies can only dream of. Selling data is a high-margin business because once it\'s collected and cleaned, reselling it to additional customers costs very little. Also consider how many employees at these firms are based offshore or in low-cost centers, further boosting margins.\\n\\nThis sets up a clear incentive: data vendors will do almost anything to protect that high-margin data business. And \\"almost anything\\" often includes holding back their own interface capabilities to avoid giving away too much value without additional payment.\\n\\nOne common tactic is imposing caps and friction on data usage in their flagship software. A financial desktop app may limit how much data you can export each month - hit the cap and you\'re stuck waiting until next month unless you pay for a more expensive package.\\n\\nI first knew about these limits because it was one of the biggest complaints I heard in our early user interviews. Later, I met someone who used to work at one of these big incumbents. Their job was monitoring each client\'s data usage, cutting them off when they exceeded certain limits, and then calling them to understand what they were doing with \\"too much\\" data. They eventually quit because they felt it was morally wrong to hamstring clients like that. But this story shows the extent of guarding the golden goose.\\n\\nThese caps and throttles are not accidental; they\'re deliberate choices to funnel users into higher-priced data plans or premium products. If you exceed your data-export limit for the month, no one in your firm can download any more data until the next month\'s reset. You can imagine how infuriating it is to be cut off mid-workflow. But from the vendor\'s perspective, it\'s protecting the golden goose of data revenue.\\n\\nAnother way vendors guard their data P&L is by creating friction to bring external data in. In theory, you\'d want your analytics workspace to ingest any data you have - proprietary models, alternative datasets - and let you see everything in one place.\\n\\nBut there\'s basically no such thing as \\"bring your own data\\" to the interface of a traditional data vendor. They are a data business. The interface is just a distribution mechanism, and the vendor is only incentivized to make that interface great as long as it results in more of their data being sold. That doesn\'t include letting clients easily plug in data from outside sources. This keeps clients dependent on the vendor\'s own data offerings and prevents any third-party data or tools from diluting the value of the vendor\'s ecosystem.\\n\\nCase in point: I recently talked with one of the big incumbents about getting access to their MCP Server. The discussion with their sales team quickly jumped into use cases. I explained that I just wanted to enable our mutual clients to access the vendor\'s data via our workspace (i.e. using our interface to consume data they\'re already entitled to). Their response was that they needed to learn more about the use case because \\"We don\'t want to take a hit on the market share of our desktop interface\\". In other words, they were worried that if clients can get the data through any interface other than the vendor\'s own, it would cannibalize their desktop business.\\n\\nThis is the incentive conflict in action, the vendor protecting its data (and the interface lock-in around that data) at the direct expense of user flexibility.\\n\\nIt gets worst, most of these large data vendors don\'t even make all of their own datasets available on their flagship desktop applications. They\'ll happily sell you the interface as a gateway to their data, but then you discover you can\'t even get all their feeds through that gateway. If you need one of those \\"off-platform\\" datasets, you might have to buy it separately and access it through a completely different channel or API.\\n\\nAll of these are designed to protect data revenue.\\n\\n### Act 2: Why it happens (inside the company)\\n\\nThe restrictions users feel externally are battles the interface team lost internally.\\n\\nInside large financial data firms, there\'s frequently a tug-of-war between the data business and the interface product team. Imagine you work at one of these incumbents and you suggest an improvement to the interface for a specific workflow. The first question from management will be: How will this result in more data sales?\\n\\nIt gets trickier when you\'re up against a PM on the data team who\'s suggesting adding a new data feed that could be packaged and sold. The data teams are the revenue engines of the company, so they get to call the shots. The desktop/interface team has the less glamorous task of maintaining and incrementally improving a mature software product that, in many cases, hasn\'t fundamentally changed in years.\\n\\nHere\'s a scenario: the interface team proposes a new feature, a way for users to seamlessly import their own CSV data into the platform to chart or analyze alongside the vendor\'s data. It\'s technically feasible and would make users very happy. But implementing it might mean users don\'t need to buy the vendor\'s extended historical data package (because they could import an alternative source they already have). The proposal gets watered down or vetoed by the data side, which argues it \\"cannibalizes\\" the product offerings.\\n\\nFrom the outside, clients just see a slow, clunky interface that never seems to embrace obvious conveniences like modern import/export tools or collaboration features. From the inside, it\'s a story of the higher-margin business overriding the user-experience improvements. The interface team might be banging the drum for usability, but the data team is banging the drum for revenue.\\n\\nAnother angle to this internal friction is how products are sold. A client might really only want to buy a raw data feed (skipping the fancy desktop software), because maybe they have their own analytics platform. But the desktop sales reps have quotas tied to selling the desktop product. If a big client opts to pay only for data and not for the interface, the desktop sales team misses out on their numbers (and likely their commissions). This leads to absurd situations where the company has an internal debate about what to offer the client, even if the client\'s preference is clear, simply because selling data alone could \\"undermine\\" the desktop business\'s targets. Different teams have conflicting goals.\\n\\nIt\'s not that the people running these companies are clueless about UX or blind to user needs; it\'s that they are conflicted. When push comes to shove, protecting the lucrative data revenue will win over improving the interface every time. These firms have essentially set up an internal hierarchy where data is king and UX is a second-class citizen.\\n\\n### Act 3: The economic reality (why this hierarchy exists)\\n\\nThese internal battles aren\'t random politics, they reflect a deeper economic reality.\\n\\nThis economic imbalance between data and interface products is key to understanding many design decisions (or lack thereof) in financial software. Simply put, data scales, software doesn\'t (as much).\\n\\n**Data products** (feed subscriptions, specialty datasets) scale incredibly well. Once the data is collected, cleaned, and stored, selling it to one more customer costs almost nothing. Each additional sale is nearly pure profit, so these businesses boast exceptionally high margins.\\n\\n**Interface products** (analytics workstations, charting applications, desktop terminals) behave like typical software. You need engineers to build new features, you need a support team to help users, there\'s ongoing maintenance and infrastructure - and it\'s hard to charge $30k/y per seat for UI. The margins here are much thinner.\\n\\nMany incumbents recognize this and actually bundle the software as long as you\'re really paying for the data underneath. Buy the data feeds, and consume it via desktop platform. This bundling obscures a reality: if you isolated the interface itself, users probably wouldn\'t be willing to pay very much for it. The willingness-to-pay resides in the data.\\n\\nThe result is that every roadmap decision for the interface is filtered through a revenue lens. Does adding a certain feature help sell more high-margin data? If yes, do it. If not (i.e., it \\"just\\" improves user experience but doesn\'t clearly drive new data subscriptions), it\'ll get de-prioritized or scrapped. This is why you see seemingly obvious usability improvements left untouched for years.\\n\\nFor instance, adding a slick code editor might be low-hanging fruit technically - lots of users would love to script and automate tasks. But if that encourages power users to pull data out of the platform (potentially bypassing some paid service or exposing data externally), it won\'t get much love internally. Conversely, adding yet another dataset (say an ESG scores package, or some new analytics feed) gets a big marketing push because it\'s a new SKU to sell.\\n\\nThe net effect of all this is a status quo where the interfaces feel archaic and user-unfriendly across the board. Not coincidentally, these vendors have barely budged on pricing or profitability for decades. In a truly competitive, user-centric market, one might expect a slick, modern UX at a lower price by now - but the incentive structure has kept competition at bay and kept vendors squarely focused on milking data profits via bundled interfaces.\\n\\nNow the pattern is clear. What looks like user-hostile design (Act 1) is actually the outcome of internal power dynamics (Act 2) driven by margin economics (Act 3).\\n\\n**This isn\'t incompetence - it\'s rational profit maximization under a specific business model.**\\n\\n## Why this persists\\n\\nA natural question is: Why haven\'t upstart competitors disrupted this model with a more user-friendly alternative?\\n\\nOne reason competition has been so stagnant is that the incumbents have a habit of doubling down on their data dominance through acquisitions. Look at the acquisition history of any major financial data vendor, and a pattern emerges: they almost always buy other data companies or content sources, not interface innovators. If a smaller company comes along with a valuable new dataset, data feed, or unique analytics content, the big players snap it up and fold that data into their empire (often keeping it exclusive to their platform). They rarely, if ever, acquire companies that innovate on the UI/UX layer.\\n\\nThis consolidation strategy means the big vendors keep enriching their data catalog (and strengthening their data monopoly) while the actual software interface remains largely the same. This prevents serious competition on the data front, which in turn protects the interface from outside disruption (because any would-be challenger would need comparable data to be useful).\\n\\nA startup might create a beautiful, modern analytics interface, but without the breadth of data that the incumbents offer, it\'s hard to convince users to switch. And if a startup focuses on building a unique dataset, one of the big vendors will likely either imitate it quickly or offer to acquire the upstart. The result is a kind of data monopoly flywheel. The big players keep getting bigger by absorbing new data sources, which raises the barrier to entry for anyone else.\\n\\n## Incentives shape everything (and change is coming)\\n\\nThe conflict between data monetization and interface usability is the quiet force that has shaped financial software for decades. Data vendors have been optimized to protect their margins; interfaces should be optimized to reduce user friction - but when one company controls both, guess which priority wins out?\\n\\nWe\'ve been living in a world where the firms selling data also control the interface through which analysts access it, and they\'ve designed that interface (consciously or not) as a sort of toll booth. It\'s not that these platforms provide no value - on the contrary, they deliver enormous value, but it\'s value delivered on the vendor\'s terms. Users feel the friction daily: the inability to easily mix in a new data source, the archaic workflows that never improve, the upsell pop-ups or usage limits that remind us who\'s really in charge.\\n\\nThe key point here is that this misalignment isn\'t due to some cluelessness or malice on the part of the companies; it\'s an incentive problem baked into a legacy business model. Understanding that is crucial. The vendor isn\'t necessarily trying to make it terrible, they\'re just not that incentivized to make it much better.\\n\\nAnd indeed, change is afoot. We\'re starting to see the early signs of a shift in this model. In the next part of this series, I\'ll dive into how a new approach - a pure-interface model decoupled from data sales - could realign incentives in favor of the user.\\n\\nIn other words, what if the company that builds your interface has no stake in selling you data?\\n\\nCould that lead to a truly user-centric financial workspace?\\n\\nI believe it can, and I\'m excited to explore that in Part II."},{"id":"the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-finance","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-finance","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-09-23-the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-finance.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-23-the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-finance.md","title":"The Evolution of AI Agents in Finance","description":"Mapping the evolution of AI agents in finance from ChatGPT wrappers to derived data insights - and why the real value is shifting from interfaces to intelligence.","date":"2025-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/finance"},{"inline":true,"label":"agents","permalink":"/blog/tags/agents"},{"inline":true,"label":"chatgpt","permalink":"/blog/tags/chatgpt"},{"inline":true,"label":"mcp","permalink":"/blog/tags/mcp"},{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"fintech","permalink":"/blog/tags/fintech"},{"inline":true,"label":"data","permalink":"/blog/tags/data"},{"inline":true,"label":"anthropic","permalink":"/blog/tags/anthropic"},{"inline":true,"label":"evolution","permalink":"/blog/tags/evolution"}],"readingTime":15.55,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-finance","title":"The Evolution of AI Agents in Finance","date":"2025-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-09-23-the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-finance","tags":["ai","finance","agents","chatgpt","mcp","openbb","fintech","data","anthropic","evolution"],"description":"Mapping the evolution of AI agents in finance from ChatGPT wrappers to derived data insights - and why the real value is shifting from interfaces to intelligence.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The hidden incentive war behind financial terminals","permalink":"/blog/the-hidden-incentive-war-behind-financial-terminals"},"nextItem":{"title":"The trampoline job - Optimize your career for growth","permalink":"/blog/the-trampoline-job-optimize-your-career-for-growth"}},"content":"![The Evolution of AI Agents in Finance](/blog/2025-09-23-the-evolution-of-ai-agents-in-finance.png)\\n\\nMapping the evolution of AI agents in finance from ChatGPT wrappers to derived data insights - and why the real value is shifting from interfaces to intelligence.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nIn late 2022, OpenAI\'s ChatGPT burst onto the scene and immediately captured the attention of finance. Almost overnight, the industry recognized that generative AI could dramatically speed up data-gathering, research, and analysis.\\n\\nWhat started as a buzz around a clever chatbot quickly ignited an arms race: How could we harness this \\"pure\\" AI intelligence specifically for finance?\\n\\nThis essay maps the acceleration of AI agents in finance, from wrapping ChatGPT around financial datasets in the early days to deep data integrations and emerging standards now. I wrap up by laying out where I believe this is heading.\\n\\n_Spoiler: the game is changing, and the real value in finance AI is shifting from fancy chat interfaces to the derived data insights those interfaces can produce._\\n\\n### Phase 1: ChatGPT wrappers on open and public data\\n\\nThe first phase of this evolution saw nimble startups harnessing AI models to make sense of _publicly available_ financial information. Using APIs and open datasets, these innovators built AI assistants that could, for example, pull stock prices, scrape financial news, or parse SEC filings and then answer questions or generate basic analyses.\\n\\nThis was the era of taking off-the-shelf AI and wrapping it around well-known data sources like EDGAR or even Yahoo Finance.\\n\\nThe beauty of Phase 1 was **accessibility**: anyone could access the same public data, so a small startup could create a financial research chatbot without needing special partnerships. Or even a big budget, as most of the cost was on the inference.\\n\\nNonetheless, these early AI agents demonstrated that even with common data, AI could deliver value by digesting mountains of information in seconds - summarizing earnings reports or comparing company metrics on the fly - tasks that would take humans hours or days.\\n\\n> The defining feature of Phase 1 was **speed of access**: information that once required hours or days of work could suddenly be retrieved and synthesized in seconds.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nHowever, because they relied only on public data, their insights were often not unique; every competitor had access to the same information. This meant that while Phase 1 proved AI\'s potential in finance, it also highlighted the next challenge: how to go beyond the readily available data to gain deeper, proprietary insights.\\n\\nAt the end of this phase, Perplexity showed up. They saw the value on the public open data, but didn\'t keep it to a few datasets. They connected LLMs to the entire web and focused on that one feature.\\n\\nThey pioneered the concept of \\"getting answers\\" from search as opposed to links. The next step after search.\\n\\nSo at the end of this phase, an analyst\'s AI assistant wasn\'t limited to static training data or a fixed library of filings; it could pull the latest news, prices, and research from the entire internet - on-the-go.\\n\\nBut web search was never meant to be a product, but a feature.\\n\\n### Phase 2: Big labs add web search\\n\\nWhile Perplexity gained a lot of market share due to the time it took big labs to add this feature, they effectively caught up.\\n\\nFor finance, this was revolutionary: market conditions change by the minute, and being able to retrieve up-to-the-moment information meant AI assistants could provide far more relevant answers. An investor could ask an AI agent about today\'s Federal Reserve announcement or a rumor affecting a stock, and the agent would actually go out, search the web, and return with an answer.\\n\\nThis phase expanded the AI\'s knowledge horizon dramatically, turning these systems into dynamic _research analysts_ that weren\'t confined by a knowledge cutoff OR by the embedding chunks that the startup had in their vector database.\\n\\n> The defining feature of Phase 2 was **breadth of access**: instead of being limited to a handful of sources, AI agents could now reach across the entire internet.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nIt did introduce new challenges, like ensuring the information found was reliable and managing the complexity of searching and reasoning on the fly, but overall Phase 2 proved that giving AI agents the tools to access external data made them significantly more powerful and context-aware.\\n\\nStartups understood that they would need to narrow down one step further, and they couldn\'t conquer the world. AI labs were coming to eat their lunch after all.\\n\\n### Phase 3: Integrating proprietary vendor data\\n\\nAs the space heated up, financial AI startups sought new ways to differentiate. The obvious next step was going beyond public web data into _proprietary financial datasets_ held by incumbent data vendors.\\n\\nInstead of just parsing SEC filings (which anyone can get), why not plug into premium data like analyst ratings from Morningstar, credit data from rating agencies, or rich financials from FactSet?\\n\\n**This phase saw startups forging partnerships with data providers to narrow their focus on high-value content not freely available on the open web**.\\n\\nFor example, Perplexity announced integrations allowing subscribers with a FactSet or Crunchbase account to query those databases through its AI. FactSet\'s own product team embraced this, noting that providing their trusted data via Perplexity\'s AI research tool created an \\"open, flexible ecosystem\\" for clients.\\n\\nIn practice, these deals meant an AI assistant could now answer questions not just from public info, but from paid datasets (e.g. _\\"What\'s the 5-year EBITDA CAGR of all companies in the S&P 500, according to FactSet?\\"_).\\n\\n> The defining feature of Phase 3 was **depth of access**: moving from shallow, open information to rich proprietary datasets that offered a competitive edge.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nStartups that secured such partnerships gained an edge, effectively becoming one-stop research copilots.\\n\\nHowever, this shift brought new _challenges_: accessing vendor data is expensive and requires legal agreements, and the AI\'s answers are only as good as the data plugged into it.\\n\\nNevertheless, the trend was clear - the most advanced finance chatbots were those tapping into **incumbent data vendors\' proprietary troves**, not just the free internet.\\n\\nFunnily enough, these big data vendors started having to have interesting discussions internally. On the one hand, they are a data business - so selling data to startups makes sense. But startups are creating derived data essentially (via answers to user prompts) so that creates a conflict of interest with their desktop businesses.\\n\\nUltimately, if a big data vendor has an AI agent on top of their fundamentals datasets that can be accessed from their desktop app, and they are selling that same underlying data to a startup that has an AI agent on top of that data, \u2026 something has to give. This is a zero sum game.\\n\\nBUT. Data vendors actually have everything to win by forging these relationships. They are slow moving, risk averse but have capital, distribution and ultimately, the main asset: the data. So for them it actually makes sense to partner with nimble startups that are bold, innovative and have nothing to lose. If nothing else, as R&D to understand the size of the market and for M&A (more on this later).\\n\\nThe main friction point that startups have here is that these datasets from big vendors are very pricey (particularly because they are redistributing this derived data) so they can only select 1 or 2 vendors to work with and consume a subset of their datasets. But also because the APIs between these vendors varies drastically.\\n\\nOnly if there was some sort of standard\u2026\\n\\n### Phase 4: Anthropic introduces MCP\\n\\nPhase 4 was the moment the game changed. Anthropic unveiled the Model Context Protocol (MCP) - and in doing so, they deliberately erased an entire category of startups.\\n\\nMCP is an open standard that lets AI assistants securely interface with any company\'s data or tools in a plug-and-play way. Instead of a bespoke integration for every vendor, firms can spin up an MCP \\"server,\\" and any compliant AI model can consume that data instantly. For finance, this meant that a provider like FactSet or PitchBook could wire their proprietary dataset straight into Claude, bypassing the need for a third-party startup to sit in the middle.\\n\\nAnd Anthropic open-sourced it. That wasn\'t just generosity, it was strategy. By making integration a commodity, they torched the moat that dozens of AI-finance startups had built their businesses around. What used to take a year of engineering and a venture round to fund could now be done with a weekend project and a config file. The \\"we connect LLMs to financial data\\" pitch evaporated almost overnight.\\n\\n> _The defining feature of Phase 4 was_ **_ease of access_**_: what once required expensive, custom integrations was suddenly standardized and commoditized._\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe labs moved fast to prove the point. Anthropic launched Claude for Financial Services, preloaded with FactSet fundamentals, Morningstar valuations, PitchBook private markets data, and S&P Capital IQ transcripts - all natively accessible inside Claude.\\n\\nThe pattern was clear: **the labs weren\'t going to verticalize into finance, they were going to hollow out the startups by giving vendors a universal port into their intelligence.**\\n\\nThis was the classic big-tech play: **commoditize your complements** (read [**Joel on Software Strategy Letter V**](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/)). The complements here were the connectors, the painstaking integrations that startups had built to justify their existence. By turning those into a free, open standard, Anthropic ensured that the value flowed not to the wrappers, but to the intelligence itself. Labs want one thing above all: for their models to be the default intelligence powering every workflow.\\n\\nAnd the best way to make that happen was to nuke the integration moat and let data vendors plug in directly.\\n\\nWhat happens when you have access to raw intelligence and can connect data from any big data vendor via MCP to it?\\n\\nAgain:\\n\\nStartups understood that they would need to narrow down one step further, and they couldn\'t conquer the world. AI labs were coming to eat their lunch after all.\\n\\n### Phase 5: From Interfaces to Insights (Derived Data)\\n\\nOnce MCP commoditized integrations, startups were forced to narrow their scope. They leaned into very specific problems: an agent to prep earnings decks, an agent to monitor ESG disclosures, an agent for company meetings. Useful, yes - but inherently smaller markets. This narrowing was the survival play: carve out niches that the frontier labs wouldn\'t immediately prioritize.\\n\\nBut firms quickly revealed what they actually valued. They didn\'t want to spend their time inside yet another agentic interface, watching an AI chain steps together. They wanted **deterministic-like outputs** from those workflows, clean, machine-generated insights that could slot directly into their existing data pipelines. Instead of asking an agent a generic question about the semi-conductor industry and then following-up on that, they wanted a report that talked about everything they should know the about semi-conductor, including replying to questions that they didn\'t know they should be asking.\\n\\nIn other words: **derived data.** Not a conversation, not a demo of agentic reasoning, but something as tangible and consumable as a sentiment feed, a risk signal, or a proprietary factor dataset.\\n\\nThis was the pivot.\\n\\n> The defining feature of Phase 5 was **intelligence on access**: not just reaching data, but transforming it into structured, consumable insights that could flow directly into existing pipelines.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe real prize wasn\'t building the workflow, it was productizing its **outputs**.\\n\\nPhase 5 marks the moment when value shifted from the _experience_ of interacting with an AI agent to the **data exhaust** those agents produce.\\n\\nStartups that recognized this started selling not \\"AI copilots\\" but new, machine-synthesized datasets that looked and felt like traditional vendor products, only built by AI.\\n\\nBut this raises a new question: if multiple providers generate competing research reports on TSMC, how does a firm evaluate which one is best? Add another agent to compare them? Sounds inception-ish. At some point, the human backstop becomes essential, especially in domains where there is no single \\"right\\" answer. In practice, this means the first wave of derivative data will deliver significant value, but as competition intensifies, advantage may once again shift toward those with privileged or proprietary sources. Or to a workspace that can handle these\u2026\\n\\n## My take on where we are heading\\n\\nGiven these trends, the likely outcomes for most AI-in-finance startups are converging around two paths.\\n\\n#### Acquisition by data vendors\\n\\nThey get acquired by big data vendors. Most likely the very same data vendor that is providing the raw data for them to generate derived insights. Not just because these big data vendors want to sell these second-order effect data as another dataset (and we know how much data acquisitions these vendors do, it\'s literally their playbook for growth), but because:\\n\\n- They want to bring the expertise of building these agentic experience on top of their data in-house\\n- As a defense mechanism in case they get acquired by another large vendor that has similar datasets (a good parallel is what happened with Meta\'s 49% acquisition of ScaleAI and what that meant for OpenAI)\\n\\nAnd honestly, they control the raw inputs, they have the distribution, they have the capital. Not buying the startups that are experimenting on their data would simply be negligence.\\n\\n### Acquisition by frontier AI labs\\n\\nThey get absorbed by the frontier labs. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google don\'t need the startup\'s UI, they want the domain expertise baked into their models.\\n\\nA team that has truly cracked bond covenant parsing, or IPO prospectuses becomes far more valuable as part of the foundation model itself. Acquisitions here aren\'t about market share; they\'re about hard-won micro domain expertise that can tip the scales in the labs\' race for vertical dominance.\\n\\n#### Consolidation\\n\\nEither way, consolidation is the destiny of this wave of startups. I don\'t think that most startups have enough leverage to stand alone once the data vendors and labs have their hooks in.\\n\\nThe only way I see startups winning big here is by being deeply integrated in large financial firms, but the value cannot be on the data or on the intelligence. It needs to be in something deeper than that, e.g. infrastructure..\\n\\n## Phase 6: Where does OpenBB fit\\n\\nIf Phase 5 was about everyone chasing derived insights, **Phase 6 is about financial firms operationalizing those insights on top of their own data.** It\'s not enough for AI agents to summarize filings or produce signals; the real value comes when firms can combine those machine-generated insights with their proprietary data, and do it securely, on their own terms.\\n\\nThis is where OpenBB comes in.\\n\\n> The defining feature of Phase 6 is **orchestration of access**: bringing together internal, external, and AI-derived data into one secure, intelligent workspace.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe big question facing financial institutions now is simple: do we build our own AI stack from scratch, or do we adopt an open workspace that\'s already designed for this purpose, and that we can fully own? Incumbent platforms like Bloomberg, FactSet, and Capital IQ were never designed to ingest a client\'s proprietary data. They have little incentive to let users integrate outside sources, because their business is selling their own datasets. This is the classic **\\"Are you team MCP client or MCP server\\"** dilemma, I wrote about it [here](https://didierlopes.beehiiv.com/p/are-you-team-mcp-client-or-server). I reckon that most of the big data vendors are team MCP Servers and they want to be the source of data into AI contexts, not the consumer of external data into their walled gardens. They are data businesses at core.\\n\\nThat\'s why OpenBB is building the opposite.\\n\\nOur vision is an open IDE for finance - an open workspace where a firm can plug in all its data sources (internal databases, vendor feeds, public datasets, even AI-derived insights) and layer on multiple AI models to generate answers, workflows, and ultimately alpha.\\n\\nJust as software developers need IDEs, analysts will still need a financial terminal for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, there wasn\'t an open source VSCode that we could have used to start building on top, so we built OpenBB Workspace. Relentlessly.\\n\\nCritically, Phase 6 also requires **deployment flexibility.** Firms want all of this to run inside their perimeter, on-prem or in a private VPC, so their proprietary edge never leaves their control.\\n\\nWe designed OpenBB that way from day one.\\n\\nThe endgame is a **unified intelligence platform for finance**: not just an AI chatbot, but a programmable workspace where human experts and AI agents collaborate over both internal and external data.\\n\\nUnlike the vendors, we aren\'t locked into selling one dataset. Unlike the labs, we aren\'t just selling raw intelligence. We\'re building the open infrastructure layer that lets firms put their proprietary edge into intelligence - securely, flexibly, and at scale.\\n\\nThat\'s why OpenBB exists. And that\'s why we have been betting on Phase 6 for so many years.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAI agents in finance have come a long way in a very short time, from the early novelty of Q&A on SEC filings, through web-enabled research assistants, to fully integrated multi-source analytics. Yet, as I\'ve argued, there\'s still another phase on the horizon.\\n\\nThe real transformation will happen when every financial institution can easily plug its own data into intelligent systems, and do so safely and efficiently. The differentiator won\'t be the chat interface, it will be the combination of internal and external data with AI, producing a constant stream of new, data-driven insights that firms can actually operationalize.\\n\\nOpenBB has been building for this phase for three years. We\'ve designed for private deployments, for open integrations, and for full transparency and control. This isn\'t a pivot for us, it\'s the phase we anticipated from the start.\\n\\nI believe in this future so strongly that I\'ve made it my life\'s work. And I\'m convinced we\'re uniquely positioned for it: there simply isn\'t another product like OpenBB in the market.\\n\\nI actually started writing this essay after noticing something in our own client conversations: firms weren\'t asking to integrate AI-finance startups as agents into our workspace.

But I think for the vast majority of the population, this is potentially a life-changing offer.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"500\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-19-the-trampoline-job-optimize-your-career-for-growth_1.png\\" alt=\\"Average VC startup offer tweet\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nSo here\'s story time.\\n\\nIn 2018, I finished my MSc in Control Systems at Imperial College London, one of the best universities in the world.\\n\\nBack then, most \\"graduate program\\" offers in London were around **\xa325\u201327k** per year. That\'s in one of the most expensive cities in Europe. To make things worse, equity wasn\'t even part of the conversation; people just didn\'t talk about it.\\n\\nThese programs also locked you in for 1\u20133 years on the same pay band, with the logic that you were \\"learning from the real world.\\"\\n\\nIf I\'d been offered something different at that point - a role at a small, ambitious startup in San Francisco - I would have taken it in a heartbeat.\\n\\n- I would have learned far more, far faster.\\n- I\'d be surrounded by like-minded people immersed in tech.\\n- I\'d be part of a company from 0 to 1, seeing how things get built from scratch.\\n- And I\'d likely have saved about the same as in London.\\n\\nThat\'s because an early-stage startup offer is not just a job. It\'s a trampoline.\\n\\n## Why it\'s a trampoline\\n\\nThe first few months are tough. You\'re absorbing everything, getting familiar with the codebase, and figuring out how to contribute real value.\\n\\nBut soon the leverage kicks in:\\n\\n- You\'re shipping faster and adding outsized impact.\\n- You\'re meeting people building cool things in adjacent spaces.\\n- You\'re doing interviews elsewhere and learning what you\'re actually worth.\\n- You\'re starting to understand how the startup is doing, and what that 0.5% equity stake might mean (spoiler: ignore the \\"non-dilution\\" mentioned above; that literally never happens).\\n\\nWithin a year, you\'ve built knowledge, credibility, and a network.\\n\\n**You now have optionality.**\\n\\nThat\'s the trampoline effect: the experience bounces you onto a higher trajectory than you could have reached through a traditional grad program.\\n\\n## Most people never get their trampoline\\n\\nInstead, they accept a safe but stagnant 9\u20135, capped by bureaucracy and slow progression.\\n\\n**By the time they realize it, the opportunity cost is massive.**\\n\\nA trampoline job isn\'t meant to be the forever job, it\'s the launchpad. If you approach it with intensity, you\'ll learn faster than anywhere else, build leverage, and set your career on an entirely different trajectory.\\n\\nSo my recommendation is to optimize early for growth, not comfort.\\n\\nLook for trampolines, not treadmills."},{"id":"how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps.md","title":"How I built an MCP Server for developers building OpenBB apps","description":"The hardest part of building an OpenBB app isn\'t writing Python, it\'s getting the widgets.json spec right.

The documentation is strong, but it is long-form, which forces you to dig around for the parts you need. That slows down iteration, especially when you just want to get an idea live in OpenBB Workspace.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nAI feels like a natural solution here. For example, providing the documentation to a model like Claude Code and asking it to generate your `widgets.json` spec.\\n\\nIf you ask Claude Code to read the docs from OpenBB, it **kind of works**. But it takes too much time (given the extensive documentation available), wastes a lot of tokens, and the model often gets confused. This is the same as using an MCP server like Context7, except that with Context7 the context is not really guaranteed to be up to date, so it is even worse.\\n\\nThe alternative is to send the exact part of the page that the model requires, which actually works pretty well. But this is very time consuming for the developer. The problem is that when you are building a complex widget, you need context from a lot of different pages, which increases the risk of not sending the right context and the model hallucinating. So basically, it **doesn\'t work either**.\\n\\nBUT.\\n\\nWhat if, instead of stuffing all the docs into context, **I built an MCP server** where every piece of the documentation is exposed as a structured, callable tool?\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps_1.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nI just had to try it.\\n\\n## 1. Breaking down the docs into building blocks\\n\\nI spent the weekend [refactoring OpenBB docs](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-docs/pull/104) into developer and analyst roles, so I understood very well the principal components that were relevant for developers.\\n\\nThere are three natural categories of building blocks:\\n\\n- **Widget types**: Plotly charts, AgGrid tables, Markdown, HTML, Metrics, etc.\\n- **Parameters and controls**: dropdowns, toggles, date pickers, text inputs, etc.\\n- **Configuration options**: grid sizing, stale times, error handling, refetch intervals, etc.\\n\\nInstead of treating the docs as one big reference, I split them into these **granular tools**.\\n\\n## 2. Adding an ad-hoc boilerplate tool\\n\\nOn top of the building blocks, I added one special tool: `building_widgets_on_openbb`.\\n\\nThis is an **ad-hoc boilerplate reference** that acts as a base. By requiring it to always be called first, I can guarantee that every widget starts from a solid baseline and everything else plugs into that baseline.\\n\\nI enforced this behavior with the following MCP tool description:\\n\\n```python\\n@mcp.tool()\\ndef building_widgets_on_openbb() -> str:\\n    \\"\\"\\"Essential boilerplate code for building OpenBB Workspace widgets. \\n    This provides the foundational FastAPI setup, CORS configuration, widgets.json endpoints, \\n    and register_widget decorator pattern. ALWAYS call this first when creating OpenBB widgets \\n    to get the required boilerplate structure.\\"\\"\\"\\n    \\n    return \\"\\"\\"# Essential Boilerplate Code for OpenBB Workspace Widgets\\n...\\n\\"\\"\\"\\n```\\n\\n## 3. Using FastMCP to turn everything into tools\\n\\nI used **FastMCP** to create a tool for each block. Every widget type, parameter, and configuration setting is its own MCP endpoint.\\n\\nSo instead of asking the AI, \\"What\'s the JSON spec for a dropdown?\\" and hoping it parses the docs correctly, the AI can just call:\\n\\n- `widget_parameters_dropdown`\\n- `widget_types_plotly_charts`\\n- `widget_configuration_grid_size`\\n\\nand immediately get valid JSON to work with.\\n\\n## 4. Deploying on Smithery.ai for easy access\\n\\nFinally, I deployed the server on Smithery.ai. That makes it discoverable, shareable, and instantly usable, with no local setup required. You can connect Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Smithery Playground to it in seconds.\\n\\nIt became immediately available [here](https://smithery.ai/server/@DidierRLopes/openbb-docs-mcp).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## 5. Testing\\n\\nBut I didn\'t just deploy and hope for the best.\\n\\nInstead, I clicked on \\"Explore capabilities\\" on the [smithery.ai page](https://smithery.ai/server/@DidierRLopes/openbb-docs-mcp) and asked it to create a complicated `widgets.json` spec for a specific widget request.\\n\\nIt didn\'t work perfectly at first.\\n\\nBut that\'s okay. I went back and improved the docs (and even realized that I needed the ad-hoc boilerplate tool).\\n\\nEventually, it worked.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps_2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps_3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps_4.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## How to use it\\n\\nHere\'s how you may use this OpenBB widgets.json spec MCP Server with Claude Code.\\n\\n1. Add this MCP Server to Claude Code (URL [here](https://server.smithery.ai/@DidierRLopes/openbb-docs-mcp/mcp))\\n\\n```bash\\nclaude mcp add --transport http openbb-docs-mcp https://server.smithery.ai/@DidierRLopes/openbb-docs-mcp/mcp\\n```\\n\\n2. Set up MCP Server and authenticate\\n\\nAnd ensure you see a \\"\u2705 connected\\"\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps_5.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n3. Then ask your prompt, and you need to confirm that CC can access these MCP tools.\\n\\nThis is what you expect to see:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps_6.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nIn the end, you should be able to get the correct `widgets.json` spec.\\n\\n## Monte Carlo stock simulation widget\\n\\nIn order to test this, I ask CC:\\n\\n_Create an OpenBB widget that has 3 parameters (ticker str, start date and boolean). The data is meant to be a plotly chart, but also support raw data. And because it\'s a monte carlo simulation, can you add a run button to it?_\\n\\nBut essentially, it allowed me to connect this one-shot widget to the workspace:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps_7.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nNote the difficulty associated with building this widget from scratch:\\n\\n- Requires adding the boilerplate code\\n- Requires a Plotly visualization with simulation paths plus percentile bands\\n- Adds 3 parameters: `ticker` (text), `start_date` (date), `use_volatility_adjustment` (boolean)\\n- Raw data mode returning pure simulation arrays\\n- A run button for manual execution\\n\\nThis example shows the end-to-end workflow:\\n\\n**AI + MCP server \u2192 OpenBB widget in minutes.**\\n\\nOne recommendation I have is to separate the data problem from the `widgets.json` specs. Make sure it works with mock data first, and once that is figured out, you just need to ensure you can push the correct data to it.\\n\\n## tl;dr\\n\\nAI as a search engine for docs is messy and inconsistent.\\n\\n**AI as a programmable assistant with tools is structured, accurate, and composable.**\\n\\nBy exposing the docs as tools, you reduce hallucinations, improve accuracy, and make it much easier for developers to mix and match widget components when building new OpenBB apps.\\n\\nHappy hacking!\\n\\n**PS:** We are actually working on introducing Widget Studio, which will greatly simplify the user experience of building custom widgets in the workspace, particularly when it comes to the UI.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-10-how-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-developers-building-openbb-apps_8.png\\" />\\n</p>"},{"id":"tracking-your-partner-health-stats-with-oura-and-ai","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tracking-your-partner-health-stats-with-oura-and-ai","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-09-06-tracking-your-partner-health-stats-with-oura-and-ai.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-06-tracking-your-partner-health-stats-with-oura-and-ai.md","title":"Tracking your partner\'s health stats with Oura and AI","description":"The rise of health tracking devices has given us unprecedented insight into our daily wellness metrics.

But what if you could use that data not just for personal optimization, but for relationship optimization?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nI was scrolling through X the other day while waiting for Claude Code to finish running something else, and I saw a post about someone using the Oura API.\\n\\nMy wife absolutely loves her Oura ring and all the metrics it provides her. The same way it gives her these insights, I realized I could have access to them too.\\n\\nBut what if on top of the metrics I had AI giving me tactical advice on how to navigate married life? Picture this:\\n\\n- She\'s slept poorly, so she\'ll be grumpy - tactical retreat recommended\\n- She\'s well-rested and in a good mood - perfect time to ask for that roast dinner\\n\\nSo on Sunday morning, I decided to quickly build something fun.\\n\\n## iOS widget\\n\\nI built a Scriptable iOS widget that displays my wife\'s health metrics in an RPG-style interface with AI-generated British humor.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-06-tracking-your-partner-health-stats-with-oura-and-ai.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n**Key features:**\\n\\n- RPG-style HP hearts showing her readiness level (\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4)\\n- Activity and Sleep score displayed on the bottom left and right corners, respectively\\n- AI-generated British humor management tips. Context includes:\\n  - Readiness score, activity score (and steps), sleep score (and hours slept)\\n  - The health data from yesterday to be used as a reference from shifts\\n  - Current datetime as recommendation will differ from the time of the day\\n  - Guidelines on the type of sentence to write\\n  - Examples of sentences - for few shot prompting\\n\\n## Step-by-step technical implementation\\n\\n### Setting up the foundation\\n\\n**Challenge**: Creating a widget that could access external APIs and display dynamic content on iOS.\\n\\n**Solution**: Used Scriptable app as the platform, which allows JavaScript execution with native iOS widget capabilities. \u2192 easy for me to access.\\n\\n### Oura API integration\\n\\nI connected to Oura Cloud API v2 endpoints and fetched multiple data streams: _daily\\\\_readiness_, _daily\\\\_sleep_, _sleep_ sessions, and _daily\\\\_activity_. Built robust error handling for API failures and handled data from multiple days for comparison metrics.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst headers = { \\"Authorization\\": `Bearer ${OURA_TOKEN}` }\\nconst readinessUrl = `https://api.ouraring.com/v2/usercollection/daily_readiness?start_date=${yesterday}&end_date=${today}`\\n```\\n\\nThis was all done with Claude Code in a few minutes.\\n\\nBefore I even touched on Scriptable, I made sure that with Meg\'s Oura PAT (personal access token) I could access the data.\\n\\nI did so by asking Claude Code to check if it could retrieve that data, and so it one-shot a few scripts to test the API and it worked perfectly.\\n\\nPreviously this used to take a bit of time because you had to read the documentation, etc - but now CC can just iterate with you quickly.\\n\\n### AI-powered contextual advice\\n\\nThis isn\'t just displaying numbers - it creates a funny sentence on what to do! I integrated OpenAI\'s model to get contextual advice based on my wife\'s raw biometric data.\\n\\nRather than just showing generic health scores, the AI actually thinks about the full picture. A 60% readiness score at 7 AM when she\'s been sleeping poorly hits way different than the same score at 9 PM after she got a good night\'s rest. Context matters.\\n\\n**My prompt:**\\n\\nThis is arguably the part that took me the longest - maybe 20 minutes or so.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst prompt = `You are a cheeky British AI assistant helping a husband manage his wife Meg. Generate a funny, dramatic 1-2 sentence management advisory based on her biometric data:\\n\\nToday metrics:\\n- Energy Level: ${ouraData.readiness}/100\\n- Sleep Quality: ${ouraData.sleep}/100  \\n- Activity Performance: ${ouraData.activity}/100\\n- Sleep Duration: ${ouraData.sleepDuration.toFixed(1)} hours\\n- Steps Taken: ${ouraData.steps}\\n- Current Time: ${timeOfDay} (${hour}:${now.getMinutes().toString().padStart(2, \'0\')})\\n\\nYesterday metrics:\\n- Activity: ${ouraData.yesterdayActivity}/100\\n- Steps: ${ouraData.yesterdaySteps}\\n- Sleep Quality: ${ouraData.yesterdaySleep || 0}/100 vs today\'s ${ouraData.sleep}/100\\n- Sleep Duration: ${(ouraData.yesterdaySleepDuration || 0).toFixed(1)}h vs today\'s ${ouraData.sleepDuration.toFixed(1)}h\\n\\nMANAGEMENT GUIDELINES:\\n- High metrics = confident wife, low maintenance mode\\n- Low metrics = deploy emergency protocols (tea, snacks, Netflix)\\n- Use British expressions: jammy, brilliant, proper, chuffed, knackered, blimey, crikey, ace, smashing\\n- Reference UK treats: tea, hobnobs, digestives, biscuits, Yorkshire tea, crumpets, chippy\\n- Time-based recommendations: morning=brew up, afternoon=snack deployment, evening=telly time\\n- Include tactical advice for optimal wife management\\n- Keep it cheeky, affectionate, and dramatically helpful\\n- No emojis in response\\n\\nExamples:\\n- \\"Wife operating at peak performance - minimal intervention required, perhaps celebratory hobnobs\\"\\n- \\"Danger zone detected: Deploy emergency tea protocol and activate Netflix immediately\\"\\n- \\"Meg\'s running on fumes - tactical retreat advised, arm yourself with digestives\\"\\n- \\"Queen is properly chuffed today - excellent time for difficult conversations\\"\\n- \\"Low battery mode activated - approach with Yorkshire tea and zero expectations\\"\\n\\nOutput a single sentence (with 1 to 2 phrases). Do not add any \\"-\\" or quotes.\\nYou are providing this recommendation to the husband.`\\n```\\n\\n### RPG-Style UI Design\\n\\nI wanted to make this actually fun to look at, so here\'s the styling that I went for:\\n\\n- **Top:** Wife\'s name + HP hearts (instant status check)\\n- **Middle:** AI tactical advice (the good stuff)\\n- **Bottom:** Raw stats for context (Activity: 85%, Sleep: 92%)\\n\\nI went with soft pink to blue gradients because my wife likes those colors, and then I can send her a screenshot of her mood.\\n\\nHere\'s how it looks in practice:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"400\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-09-06-tracking-your-partner-health-stats-with-oura-and-ai_1.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nAnd you can see that I acted immediately on the recommendation by bringing a coffee and hobnobs \ud83d\ude04\\n\\n## Implement it yourself\\n\\nI\'m sharing the complete code so you can recreate this for yourself. The full implementation including all the API integration, caching logic, AI prompting, and UI design.\\n\\nYou\'ll just need:\\n\\n1. An Oura API token (from your partner\'s account, with permission!)\\n2. An OpenAI API key\\n3. The Scriptable app on iOS\\n\\nFeel free to customize the AI personality, adjust the health metrics display, or modify the caching intervals to suit your needs.\\n\\n## Other thoughts\\n\\nImagine the alpha potential in tracking health stats of executives at public companies:\\n\\n- CEO sleep patterns before earnings calls\\n- Recovery metrics during crisis periods\\n- Team health dynamics during product launches\\n\\nIf you knew that a company\'s leadership team was consistently sleep-deprived, highly stressed, and showing declining health metrics leading up to a major product launch, wouldn\'t that inform your investment decisions?\\n\\nWe might be heading toward a world where VCs require portfolio company founders to wear Oura rings. Imagine the due diligence: \\"_Your burn rate looks good, your team is solid, but your founder\'s recovery score has been below 60% for three months straight. That\'s a red flag._\\"\\n\\nAnother thought is that Oura is potentially sitting on a gold mine? The patterns in sleep, stress, and recovery among successful entrepreneurs, executives, and decision-makers could be worth more than the hardware business itself.\\n\\nImagine how much HFs would pay to get access to these health stats from high-level execs at companies under their mandate."},{"id":"fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-09-02-fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-02-fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts.md","title":"Fine-tuning a LLM on my blog posts","description":"Ever wondered what it would be like to have an AI that writes exactly in your style?

And this task didn\u2019t leave my TODO for the past 6 months.\\n\\nSo I finally took things to my hands last weekend, and I\u2019m going to share the entire journey on what, why and how.\\n\\nBuckle up, this will be a long post - and more technical than previous ones. And all the code will be available here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/fine-tune-llm.\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nMost AI models are like Wikipedia - they know a little about everything but lack the depth and personality that comes from lived experience.\\n\\nThink of it this way: RAG is like giving someone a reference book during an exam. Fine-tuning is like actually teaching them the subject until it becomes part of how they think.\\n\\n> _\u201cOnce you\u2019ve maximized the performance gains from prompting, you might wonder whether to do RAG or finetuning next. The answer depends on whether your model\u2019s failures are information-based or behavior-based._\\n> \\n> _If the model fails because it lacks information, a RAG syustem that gives the model access to the relevant sources of information can help. (\u2026) On the other hand, if the model has behavioral issues, finetuning might help.\u201d_\\n> <br />\\n> \\\\- Chip Huyen\u2019s - AI Engineering (Chapter 7: Finetuning)\\n<br />\\n\\nWhen you fine-tune a model on your writing, you\'re not just feeding it information (particularly with small models and a LoRA - you\'re rewiring how it processes and responds to ideas. The same neural pathways that learned to write about quantum physics now learn your specific way of sharing thoughts on open source, MCP, boxing, and others.\\n\\nIn this case, because we will fine-tune an instruct model - even the system prompt becomes part of this personalization process from the very first token. It\u2019s not a simple \u201cYou are a helpful assistant\\" but \u201cYou are Didier, CEO of OpenBB. You write with clarity and impact, focusing on fintech, open source, AI, and the future of research workflows\u201d.\\n\\nThis will result in a fine-tuned model that thinks in your voice and operates with your expertise baseline. To some extent that is, we will see later that the information transfer could be better. I attribute that to the fact that we are using a small (3.8B model), we are doing partial fine-tuning (only 0.08% of weights will be updated) and I didn\u2019t spend a lot of time iterating on the hyperparameters.\\n\\n## 0. Setting up the foundation\\n\\n### Model\\n\\nI chose **Microsoft\'s Phi-3 mini model (3.8B parameters)** for several strategic reasons beyond just \\"it fits on my Mac\\":\\n\\n**Technical sweet spot**: At 3.8B parameters, Phi-3 mini hits the perfect balance - large enough to produce coherent, contextual responses, but small enough to fine-tune efficiently on consumer hardware. Larger models like 7B+ would require more aggressive quantization.\\n\\n**Instruct-optimized foundation**: This isn\'t a raw base model. Phi-3 mini is already instruction-tuned with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and likely RLHF, meaning it understands how to follow prompts and maintain conversational flow. This gives me a much better starting point than training from a base model. Note: Microsoft actually did not release the base model.\\n\\n**Ecosystem support**:\\n- This [code reference](https://gist.github.com/andrewssobral/89ca0cd40e609a32c0ce8241d01f484d) gave me a working starting point\\n- There was an [official cookbook](https://github.com/microsoft/PhiCookBook/blob/main/md/03.FineTuning/FineTuning_MLX.md) with best practices\\n- There was a good [model card on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct) with clear usage example\\n<br />\\n\\n**Hardware compatibility**: With my M3 Max and 48GB RAM, this model fits comfortably in memory with room for LoRA adapters and training overhead.\\n\\n### Finetuning Technique\\n\\nTraditional fine-tuning updates all 3.8 billion parameters, requiring enormous compute resources and risking catastrophic forgetting (where the model loses its general capabilities while learning your specific data).\\n\\n**LoRA\'s elegant solution**: Low-Rank Adaptation works by decomposing weight updates into smaller matrices. Instead of modifying a large weight matrix W directly, LoRA adds two smaller matrices `A` and `B` such that the update becomes `W + BA`, where `B` has rank `r` and `r << d` (with `d` being the original dimensions). More on LoRA [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/developer_guides/lora).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-09-02-fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts_2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nWhy this matters:\\n- **Parameter efficiency**: I\'m only training a small percentage (`<0.2%`) of the entire 3.8b model\\n- **Memory efficiency**: Base model stays frozen, only adapter weights need gradients\\n- **Modularity**: Can swap different LoRA adapters for different tasks/personalities\\n- **Reduced overfitting**: Smaller parameter space makes it harder to memorize training data (which also validates the fact that fine-tuning is not best choice to give more information to a model)\\n\\n### Framework\\n\\nMLX is specifically designed for Apple\'s unified memory architecture. While PyTorch can run on Mac, it wasn\'t built with Apple Silicon\'s unique characteristics in mind.\\n\\nKey MLX benefits:\\n- **Memory efficiency**: Unified memory means no CPU/GPU transfers, LoRA adapters and base model share the same memory pool efficiently\\n- **Lazy evaluation**: Only computes what\'s needed, when it\'s needed - crucial for memory-constrained fine-tuning\\n- **Native optimization**: Built for Apple\'s AMX (Apple Matrix Extensions) and Neural Engine integration\\n\\nMost production fine-tuning still happens on NVIDIA GPUs with PyTorch. But for Apple Silicon users, MLX offers several advantages:\\n\\n- **Lower barrier to entry**: No need for cloud GPUs or expensive NVIDIA hardware\\n- **Rapid experimentation**: Faster iteration cycles for smaller models\\n- **Privacy**: Everything runs locally, no data leaves your machine\\n\\nNote that I was able to do this because I was working with a \\\\<10B parameter model and had Apple Silicon with 48GB RAM. But more importantly, this was done for experimentation, and not production - so I chose what allowed me to get my hands dirty faster.\\n\\n## 1. Preparing the data\\n\\nCode can be found here: [https://github.com/DidierRLopes/fine-tune-llm/blob/main/scripts/01_prepare_data.py](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/fine-tune-llm/blob/main/scripts/01_prepare_data.py).\\n\\nFor the data we will be using a [Q&A dataset based on my blogposts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/didierlopes/my-blog-qa-dataset). The repository where I turned my blog posts into this dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/turn-blog-feed-into-qa-dataset/tree/main).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-09-02-fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts_3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThe dataset contains 91 blog posts transformed into conversational Q&A pairs - roughly 2,100 exchanges covering everything from OpenBB\'s journey to technical deep-dives on open source.\\n\\nEach entry in the dataset contains conversations with user questions and my responses. But raw conversational data (which I parsed from a blogpost) isn\'t something you can just throw at a model. It needs structure, and more importantly, **it needs the right structure** for your chosen model.\\n\\n### Formatting for phi-3-mini-4k-instruct \\n\\nPhi-3-mini-4k-instruct has been trained with a specific chat template, and we need to follow it - otherwise results won\'t be optimal (this was one of my first mistakes!)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-09-02-fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts_4.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nYou can find that template in the model card on HF: [https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct)\\n\\nImportant: Since this is an instruct model, then it is important to retain the system prompt on the training samples. (I also did a mistake here!)\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\n<|system|>\\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|end|>\\n<|user|>\\nHow to explain Internet for a medieval knight?<|end|>\\n<|assistant|>\\n```\\n\\nThose special tokens (`<|system|>`, `<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, `<|end|>`) aren\'t decorative, they\'re semantic markers that tell the model exactly where each part of the conversation begins and ends. (Do not forget these, and ensure there are no typos! I did not do a mistake here ehe)\\n\\nI actually added a function to validate if the required tokens existed, and are in the right order.\\n\\n### Training split\\n\\nOne of the most common mistakes in fine-tuning is treating your test data as validation data. Here\'s how I split the ~2,100 samples:\\n\\n- **Training (80%, ~1,700 samples)**: The model learns from these\\n- **Validation (10%, ~210 samples)**: Monitors training progress in real-time.\\n  - In typical ML systems, this is used to tweak hyper parameters. In this case it checks the validation loss during training - and allows you to avoid overfitting, by making sure that training loss doesn\u2019t diverge from validation loss.\\n- **Test (10%, ~210 samples)**: Final evaluation, never touched during training\\n\\nBut before splitting, I **shuffle all samples from all conversations**. This avoids temporal bias where training data represents one era of thinking while test data represents another.\\n\\nOne of the reasons for which I recommend displaying the number of samples is so that you can put yourself in the shoes of the model to understand how many samples it will see; and that will help you make better decisions in terms of the training and model configs. \\n\\n<details summary=\\"Preparing data logs\\">\\n\\n<CodeBlock language=\\"bash\\">\\n{`$ python scripts/01_prepare_data.py --config config/data_config.yaml\\n\\n============================================================\\nDATA PREPARATION PIPELINE\\n============================================================\\n\\n>>> Step 1: Loading raw dataset...\\n\\nLoading dataset: didierlopes/my-blog-qa-dataset\\nDataset loaded successfully.

Train the model\\n\\nCode can be found here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/fine-tune-llm/blob/main/scripts/02_train_model.py.\\n\\n### Model configuration\\n\\n```yaml\\n  base_model:\\n    path: \\"microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\\"\\n\\n  lora:\\n    num_layers: 32\\n    lora_layers: 32\\n    rank: 16\\n    scale: 20.0\\n    dropout: 0.1\\n    keys:\\n      - \\"self_attn.q_proj\\"\\n      - \\"self_attn.k_proj\\"\\n      - \\"self_attn.v_proj\\"\\n      - \\"self_attn.o_proj\\"\\n```\\n\\n#### Lora layers\\n\\nFrom [phi-3-mini-4k-instruct config file](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct/blob/main/config.json) we know that it has 32 hidden layers (i.e. 32 transformer blocks comprised of multi-head self-attention, feed-forward network, and residual connections + layer norms).\\n\\nIn transformer models like Phi-3, different layers learn different levels of abstraction:\\n- **Bottom layers (1-10) - \\"grammar\\"**: Learn fundamental language patterns - grammar, syntax, basic word associations. These layers understand that \\"CEO\\" is a noun, that it often precedes \\"of\\", and basic sentence structure.\\n- **Middle layers (11-20) - \\"reasoning\\"**: Build conceptual understanding - connecting ideas, understanding context, domain knowledge. These layers learn that \\"OpenBB\\" relates to \\"finance\\" and \\"open source\\", that \\"Terminal\\" in my context means a financial analysis tool, not a computer interface.\\n- **Top layers (21-32) - \\"style & expression\\"**: Handle vocabulary selection and style - choosing specific words, maintaining tone, formatting responses. These layers decide whether to say \\"leverage\\" vs \\"use\\", whether to include technical details, how to structure explanations.\\n\\nMost fine-tuning tutorials suggest only adapting the top 8-16 layers because it\'s more memory-efficient and often sufficient for simple style transfer. But my writing isn\'t just about word choice - it\'s about how I conceptually approach topics:\\n\\n- When I discuss technical topics, I ground them in practical examples (middle layers)\\n- I have specific patterns of explanation - starting broad, then diving deep (bottom-middle layers)\\n- My sentence construction tends toward clarity over complexity (bottom layers)\\n\\nAlso, I often change the order of the words due to Portuguese being my primary language - although not correct, ultimately I\u2019m trying to fine-tune a model to represent my writing better. So, in this case, I adapted all 32 layers.\\n\\nAlthough this happened when I was fine-tuning those 3.1M parameters \ud83d\ude2d\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-09-02-fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts_5.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Attention matrices\\n\\nIn LoRA, the matrices you can adapt are:\\n\\n- **Attention projections**: Query, Key, Value, Output\\n  - This is the most common and impactful, it changes which tokens pay attention to which and how strongly. Ultimately, this is where the reasoning comes from.\\n- **Feed-forward (MLP) projections**: W1, W2\\n  - Changes how representations are transformed nonlinearly - not the most common\\n- **Embeddings & LM head**: token embedding matrix and output head\\n  - Almost never adapted\\n\\nWe went with the attention projections to adapt the complete attention mechanism. Picking FFN matrices would make adapters 2-3x larger, and I didn\u2019t think it was worth it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Rank\\n\\nLoRA works by adding to a big weight matrix of dimension `d x d`, and adapted weight matrix of dimension `(d,d)` - where `d` is the hidden_size and can be found in model config, in our case, `3072`.\\n\\nSo wait, LoRA adds a matrix of size `3072 \xd7 3072`?\\n\\nYes and no.\\n\\nIt does, but in a smart way - and this is where **rank** comes into play.\\n\\nLoRA adapts two matrices called `A` and `B`, where `A` is of dimension `(d,r)` and `B` is of dimension `(r,d)`. The `r` value is the **rank**. And although multiplying these matrices results in a matrix of size `(d,d)`, the number of parameters on `A` and `B` combined is `2dr`.\\n\\nSo,\\n\\n- **Low rank (small r**), LoRA can only make coarse adjustments (cheap, fast).\\n- **High rank (large r)**, LoRA can make finer adjustments (better fidelity, but heavier).\\n\\nI actually started with 8 on this one, but results weren\u2019t the best so I doubled it.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-09-02-fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts_6.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nNote: The `AxB` multiplication that happens which results in the new `W` matrix adapter is normalized by `r`. This makes it so the update\u2019s magnitude stays roughly stable regardless of rank, otherwise `r` would linearly increase variance of the update.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Scale\\n\\nWhat if you actually wanted there to be higher variance of the update?\\n\\nAs in, you wanted LoRA update to influence even more the frozen weight?\\n\\nThis is where the **scale** parameter `\u03b1` comes into play.\\n\\n- **Small scale \u03b1**: LoRA update has a subtle effect.\\n- **Large scale \u03b1**: LoRA update dominates more strongly.\\n\\nMost PyTorch examples use `1.0`-`5.0`, but MLX\'s implementation benefits from higher scales - the community suggests `2 * rank` as a rule of thumb, so that LoRA adapters weights don\u2019t get drowned out by the base model frozen weights.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### Dropout\\n\\nDropout `p` is cheap insurance against overfitting when your fine-tune dataset is narrow (e.g., aligning a model to one person\u2019s writing style) or you have a small dataset (e.g. a few thousand samples). It works by randomly zeroing out parts of the low-rank update with probability `p` (0-1).\\n\\n- **Too much dropout**: Slows learning (adapter doesn\u2019t specialize enough).\\n- **Too little dropout**: Adapter memorizes quirks instead of general style.\\n\\nIf dataset is huge (not our case lol), often the dropout is skipped altogether since there isn\u2019t the risk of overfitting (I mean it depends on the model a bit, but yea).\\n\\nWe went with `0.1`, which falls under the recommendation.\\n\\n\\n### Training Configuration\\n\\n```yaml\\ntraining:\\n  iters: 2000\\n  batch_size: 4\\n  learning_rate: 1e-5\\n  steps_per_eval: 50\\n  grad_checkpoint: true\\n  \\noptimizer:\\n  type: \\"adam\\"\\n  \\nmetrics:\\n  patience: 5\\n  min_delta: 0.001\\n  \\npaths:\\n  train_data: \\"data/processed/train.json\\"\\n  test_data: \\"data/processed/test.json\\"\\n  logs_dir: \\"logs/training\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe training hyperparameters rationale:\\n\\n- **Batch size 4**: Larger batches (8-16) provide more stable gradients but require more memory and can miss fine details. Smaller batches (1-2) are noisy. 4 felt like a good sweet spot.\\n  - With ~1,700 training samples and batch size 4, that means that there are 425 steps/epoch. An epoch corresponds to a full pass through the training dataset.\\n\\n- **2000 iterations**: With 425 steps per epoch and 2000 total steps, that means that there are roughly 5 epochs.\\n  - This means that the model has seen each of the 1,700 examples ~5 times (in slightly different shuffles).\\n  - If you kept training further (10\u201320 epochs), you risk overfitting, memorizing samples instead of generalizing.\\n\\n- **Adam** stands for **Adaptive Momentum Estimation**, it is one of the model widely used optimizers in deep learning, and an extension of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This was an easy choice.\\n  - Adaptive - each parameter gets its own learning rate (scaled by gradient history).\\n  - Momentum - smooths updates, prevents oscillations.\\n  - Automatic scaling - no need to tune learning rate schedules as much as vanilla SGD.\\n\\n- **Learning rate 1e-5**: This controls how big each update step is when adjusting parameters during training. Luckily, there are good rules of thumbs for this value in LoRA / LLM fine-tuning:\\n  - Full fine-tunes (big models): 1e-5 to 1e-4\\n  - LoRA fine-tunes (small adapters): 1e-5 is a very common sweet spot\\n  - If unstable: drop to 5e-6 or even 1e-6\\n  - If underfitting (loss barely moving): try 2e-5 or 3e-5\\n\\n- **Evaluation every 50 steps**: Frequent enough to catch overfitting early (40 checks across training), but not so frequent that it slows training.\\n  - Each evaluation on 210 validation samples takes ~30 seconds.\\n\\n- **Gradient checkpointing** is a memory-saving technique that reduces GPU usage during training by only storing a subset of intermediate activations in the forward pass. When the backward pass runs, the missing activations are recomputed on the fly, which increases compute time but dramatically lowers memory requirements.\\n  - Frees up memory so we can fit a batch size of 4 instead of 2, improving gradient stability.\\n  - The ~20% slower training is a reasonable trade-off compared to the benefits.\\n\\n- **Early stopping (patience 5 and min delta 0.001)**: If validation loss doesn\'t improve by 0.001 for 5 consecutive evaluations (250 iterations), training halts.\\n\\n### The training process\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"1000\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-09-02-fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts_7.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nTraining isn\'t just about pressing \\"run\\" and waiting. It\'s an active process of monitoring, adjusting, and sometimes killing runs that aren\'t working.\\n\\nLet me walk you through what\'s actually happening when we fine-tune the model:\\n\\n1. Load base Phi-3 model (3.8B parameters)\\n2. Freeze base model weights - these never change\\n3. Add LoRA adapters (3.1M trainable params, ~0.08% of total)\\n4. Train only the adapters using validation for monitoring\\n\\nThe magic here is that the training only updates the tiny LoRA matrices, but the combined output leverages the full 3.8B parameter knowledge base.\\n\\nDuring each forward pass, the frozen base model produces its output, and the LoRA adapters add their learned adjustments on top - scaled by a factor of 20.0 to make the adaptations significant enough to matter.\\n\\nIn fact, every forward pass, the model processes 4 samples (batch_size), predicts the next tokens, and compares them to the actual tokens. The loss quantifies how wrong it was. Backpropagation then updates only the LoRA weights to reduce this loss.\\n\\nDuring backpropagation, gradients flow only to the LoRA adapters - the base model parameters never receive gradients and never change.\\n\\nEvery 50 steps, I evaluate on validation data. \\n\\n- Training loss dropping, validation loss dropping\\n  - **Learning** - this is what you want! Model is learning from training data and generalizing to unseen validation data.\\n- Training loss dropping, validation loss flat\\n  - **Approaching capacity** - model is learning from the training data, but it\u2019s no longer generalizing better to unseen data. The model is \\"full\\" with the representational flexibility given. This is different from underfitting, where the model wouldn\u2019t even be learning more from the training data.\\n- Training loss dropping, validation loss rising\\n  - **Overfitting** - the model is \u201cmemorizing\u201d training data examples. Time to stop, or early stoppage will take care of it.\\n- Both losses flat\\n  - Learning rate too low or model saturated (and we need to go back to tweaking hyperparameters).\\n\\nMy training showed steady improvement until iteration ~1,500, where validation loss plateaued around 2.8. The training got halted here due to my patience-based early stoppage (patience 5 - i.e. 250 iterations, min delta 0.001). This saved me from overfitting and wasted compute on iterations 1,500-2,000 where no meaningful learning occurred.\\n\\nUltimately, this told me the model had extracted what it could from the data.\\n\\nBut what does a validation loss of 2.8 mean?\\n\\nValidation loss of 2.8 translates to a perplexity of ~16.4. This means on average, the model thinks there are about 16 equally likely next tokens at each step.\\n\\nFor context, random guessing would be the vocabulary size (e.g. ~32,000) and a perfect model would have 1. So 16.4 is pretty good.\\n\\nNote: The 3.1M parameters aren\'t learning language from scratch - they\'re learning how to nudge an already-capable model toward our specific use case. That\'s why LoRA is so sample-efficient and why we can achieve good results with relatively small datasets.\\n\\nThe base model retains all its general knowledge while the LoRA adapters inject domain-specific expertise. It\'s like having a general practitioner doctor (base model) who takes a specialized course (LoRA training) to better handle specific types of cases, without forgetting their general medical knowledge.\\n\\nTraining is fundamentally about finding the right balance: enough learning to improve performance, but not so much that you overfit to your training data. The validation curve is your compass, and early stopping is your safety net.\\n\\n\\n<details summary=\\"Training model logs\\">\\n\\n<CodeBlock language=\\"bash\\">\\n{`$ python scripts/02_train_model.py --model-config config/model_config.yaml --training-config config/training_config.yaml --train-data data/processed/train.json --val-data data/processed/val.json --test-data data/processed/test.json\\n\\n============================================================\\nMODEL TRAINING PIPELINE\\n============================================================\\n\\nModel config: config/model_config.yaml\\nTraining config: config/training_config.yaml\\nTraining data: data/processed/train.json\\nValidation data: data/processed/val.json\\nTest data: data/processed/test.json (for final evaluation only)\\n\\nMetrics logging to: logs/training\\n\\n============================================================\\nSTARTING FINE-TUNING PIPELINE\\n============================================================\\n\\nLoading training data from: data/processed/train.json\\nLoading validation data from: data/processed/val.json\\nLoaded 1705 training samples\\nLoaded 212 validation samples\\nLoading base model: microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\\n\\nFetching 13 files: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 13/13 [00:00<00:00, 46924.23it/s]\\n\\nModel loaded successfully\\n\\nLoRA config saved to: models/adapters/adapter_config.json\\nFreezing base model parameters...\\nConverting linear layers to LoRA layers...\\nLoRA setup completed:\\n  Trainable parameters: 3,145,728 (0.08%)\\n  Total parameters:     3,824,225,280\\nSetting up adam optimizer with learning rate: 1e-05\\n\\n============================================================\\nTRAINING CONFIGURATION SUMMARY\\n============================================================\\n\\n\ud83d\udcca Dataset:\\n  Training samples:   1705\\n  Validation samples: 212\\n\\n\ud83d\udd27 LoRA Configuration:\\n  Layers to adapt:  32/32\\n  LoRA rank:        16\\n  LoRA scale:       20.0\\n  Dropout:          0.1\\n  Target layers:    self_attn.q_proj, self_attn.k_proj, self_attn.v_proj, self_attn.o_proj\\n\\n\ud83d\udcc8 Training Parameters:\\n  Iterations:       2000\\n  Batch size:       4\\n  Learning rate:    1e-5\\n  Eval frequency:   50\\n  Grad checkpoint:  True\\n\\nStarting training...\\nTraining on 1705 samples\\nValidating on 212 samples\\nStarting training..., iters: 2000\\nIter 1: Val loss 2.399, Val took 12.519s\\n  Iteration 1: Val loss = 2.3986, Perplexity = 11.01\\n  \u2192 New best validation loss: 2.3986 (perplexity: 11.01)\\nIter 10: Train loss 2.242, Learning Rate 1.000e-05, It/sec 0.805, Tokens/sec 484.578, Trained Tokens 6021, Peak mem 8.924 GB\\n  Iteration 10: Train loss = 2.2423\\nIter 20: Train loss 1.522, Learning Rate 1.000e-05, It/sec 0.815, Tokens/sec 487.475, Trained Tokens 12004, Peak mem 8.924 GB\\n  Iteration 20: Train loss = 1.5223\\nIter 30: Train loss 1.319, Learning Rate 1.000e-05, It/sec 0.580, Tokens/sec 464.444, Trained Tokens 20014, Peak mem 11.472 GB\\n  Iteration 30: Train loss = 1.3188\\n\\n(...)\\n\\n============================================================\\nTRAINING SUMMARY\\n============================================================\\n\\n\ud83d\udcca Training Completion:\\n  Total iterations:     200\\n  Early stopped:        True\\n  Final train loss:     0.9613\\n  Final val loss:       1.0499\\n  Best val loss:        1.0393\\n  Final perplexity:     2.86\\n  Best perplexity:      2.83\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f  Training stopped early due to lack of improvement\\n   Patience counter reached: 24/5\\n\\n\ud83d\udcc1 Output Files:\\n  Adapters: models/adapters/\\n  Training logs: logs/training/\\n  Metrics plot: logs/training/training_metrics.png`}\\n</CodeBlock>\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n## 3. Evaluate the model\\n\\nCode can be found here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/fine-tune-llm/blob/main/scripts/03_evaluate_model.py.\\n\\nThe evaluation process answers a critical question:\\n\\n**Did the fine-tuning actually improve the model?**\\n\\nWe compare two models:\\n\\n1. **Base model**: The original Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct (our baseline)\\n2. **Fine-tuned model**: Base model + our trained LoRA adapters applied at runtime\\n\\n### Step 1: Loading models for comparison\\n\\nFor the base model evaluation, you need need to load the original model from HF.\\n\\n```python\\nmodel, tokenizer = load(\\"microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\\")\\n```\\n\\nFor the fine-tuned model evaluation, you need to load the original model from HF AND apply the adapters at runtime.\\n\\n```python\\nmodel, tokenizer = load(\\"microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\\") model.freeze()  # Freeze the base weights\\nlinear_to_lora_layers(model, lora_config)  # Add LoRA layers\\nmodel.load_weights(\\"adapters.safetensors\\")  # Load trained weights\\n```\\n\\nWe\'re not loading a completely different model file. We\'re taking the original model and applying the learned adapter weights on top of it at runtime.\\n\\n### Step 2: Test data generation\\n\\nFor each test question, both models generate responses.\\n\\nE.g. \\"What is machine learning?\\"\\n\\n```python\\nbase_response = generate(base_model, tokenizer, question, max_tokens=200)\\nfinetuned_response = generate(finetuned_model, tokenizer, question, max_tokens=200)\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Measuring performance\\n\\nWe utilized world overlap as a simple and interpretable metric. It compares predicted words vs reference answer words. Uses Jaccard similarity: overlap = intersection/union.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n- Reference: \\"Machine learning uses algorithms and data\\"\\n- Prediction: \\"ML uses algorithms to learn from data\\"\\n- Overlap: 4 words match out of 7 unique = 57%\\n\\nA better eval (out-of-scope for this work) would be to implement a version of LMArena where I would ask a question, and get two answers (one from base model and one from fine-tuned) and then I would select which one looked more like my writing without knowing which is which.\\n\\n<details summary=\\"Evaluate model logs\\">\\n\\n<CodeBlock language=\\"bash\\">\\n{`$ python scripts/03_evaluate_model.py --config config/evaluation_config.yaml --test-data data/processed/test.json --adapters-path models/adapters --base-model microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\\n\\n============================================================\\nMODEL EVALUATION PIPELINE\\n============================================================\\nStandard evaluation: Base + Runtime LoRA Adapters\\n\\n\ud83d\udd38 Step 1: Evaluating Base Model\\n============================================================\\nEVALUATING MODEL: base_model\\n============================================================\\nLoading model: microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\\nFetching 13 files: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 13/13 [00:00<00:00, 16008.79it/s]\\nModel loaded successfully\\nLoading test data from: data/processed/test.json\\nExtracted 212 test questions\\nGenerating predictions for 212 questions...\\nGenerating predictions:   0%|  \\n\\n(...)\\n\\nGenerating predictions: 100%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 212/212 [15:24<00:00,  4.36s/it]\\nCalculating metrics for 212 samples...\\nCalculating word overlap scores...\\n\\n============================================================\\nBASE_MODEL EVALUATION RESULTS\\n============================================================\\n\\n\ud83d\udcca Word Overlap Metrics:\\n  Mean:    0.1574\\n  Median:  0.1586\\n  Std:     0.0443\\n  Range:   [0.0357, 0.2778]\\n\\n\ud83d\udccf Length Statistics:\\n  Predictions: 864.6 chars (\xb1163.1)\\n  References:  405.8 chars (\xb1186.8)\\n============================================================\\nMetrics saved to: logs/evaluation/base_model_evaluation.json\\n\\nEvaluation completed!

While the base model gives consistently mediocre responses, our fine-tuned model shows more range - it\'s capable of both the baseline performance and significantly better responses.\\n\\n### Range expansion\\n\\n- **Base model range**: [0.0357, 0.2778]\\n- **FT range**: [0.0449, 0.3913]\\n\\nThe fine-tuned model\'s maximum score (0.3913) significantly exceeds the base model\'s best performance (0.2778). This 41% jump in peak performance shows the model learned to generate responses that better match the reference style and content.\\n\\n### Length analysis\\n\\n- **Reference Length**: 405.8 characters (\xb1186.8)\\n- **Base model**: 864.6 characters (\xb1163.1) - verbose, unfocused\\n- **FT model**: 381.9 characters (\xb172.9) - concise, targeted\\n\\nThis is perhaps the most telling insight. The base model generates responses that are 2.2x longer than the references, suggesting verbose, unfocused answers.\\n\\nThe fine-tuned model produces responses much closer to the reference length (381.9 vs 405.8 characters), with lower variability (\xb172.9 vs \xb1163.1), indicating it learned the appropriate response style and length.\\n\\n### Parameter efficiency\\n\\n- Total parameters: 3.82B\\n- Trainable parameters: 3.15M (0.08%)\\n- Performance gain: +27.6%\\n\\nWe achieved nearly 28% better performance by training just 0.08% of the model\'s parameters. This represents exceptional parameter efficiency - roughly 345% improvement per percentage point of parameters trained.\\n\\n### Statistical interpretation\\n\\nWhat 20.08% Word Overlap Actually Means: In a 100-word response, our fine-tuned model shares about 20 words with the reference answer. While this might seem low, it\'s actually strong performance because:\\n\\n- **Multiple valid phrasing**: \\"quick\\" vs \\"fast\\", \\"big\\" vs \\"large\\"\\n- **Different valid approaches**: Same facts, different explanations\\n- **Context variations**: References are specific examples, predictions are generalizations\\n\\nThe key insight is relative improvement. The base model achieved 15.74% overlap - our fine-tuning pushed this to 20.08%, crossing an important threshold where responses become noticeably more aligned with expected answers.\\n\\n## Vibe checking\\n\\nResults and statistics are great, but there\u2019s nothing like actually playing with the models and vibe check results. This is why I created [interactive_chat.py file](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/fine-tune-llm/blob/main/scripts/interactive_chat.py), so that we can ask a question - and we get responses from the base model but also fine-tuned model (and fused if it exists).\\n\\n_**Prompt: \\"What is machine learning?\\"**_\\n\\n**Base model**: _\\"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of computer programs and algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. In machine learning, algorithms use computational methods to identify patterns in data, learn from those patterns, and then make decisions or predictions based on the data they\'ve studied._\\n\\n_There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning._\\n\\n_1. Supervised learning: In this approach, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that the input data is paired with the desired output. The algorithm learns to map input data to output data based on this training. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the output for new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning include classification (predicting a category or label) and regression (predicting a numerical value)._\\n\\n_2. Unsupervised learning\\"_\\n\\n**LoRA runtime (base + adapters)**: _Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to learn and improve from data, without being explicitly programmed. It encompasses techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, which enable systems to make predictions, detect patterns, and make decisions based on large amounts of data._\\n\\n**Fused model**: _Machine learning is a field of computer science that focuses on building algorithms capable of learning and improving from data, without explicit programming. It involves developing models that can make predictions or decisions based on input data, often through complex statistical techniques and mathematical optimization._\\n\\n<details

It is recommended to use the fused model when:\\n\\n- Deploying to production\\n- Inference speed is critical\\n- You want a single model file\\n- Sharing with users who aren\'t familiar with LoRA\\n\\nIt also uses less memory, since you have a single model instead of a model + its adapters.\\n\\nHowever, keeping adapters may still be important, particularly when\\n\\n- Experimenting with different configurations\\n  - E.g. if you wanted to fine tune based on your blogs\\n- Storage/bandwidth is limited\\n  - This is why I pushed the adapters to HF and not the fused model\\n- You need to swap between multiple fine-tuned versions\\n\\nNote: Fusion is a one-way operation. Once fused, you can\'t extract the adapters back out. Always keep your original adapter files as your \\"source of truth\\".

Portfolio Performance & Exposure\\n\\nI like it because it\u2019s a classic - one of the first strong apps we put together and showed in the FDP presentation. Track overall portfolio performance, returns by asset class, sector exposures, and risk metrics like drawdown or volatility, then generate clean summaries for internal reviews or external stakeholders.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-25-top-10-openbb-apps_1.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## 2. Draft Investor Letter\\n\\nThis builds on the portfolio app. It allows firms to automate an investor letter end-to-end by pulling live portfolio data, performance charts, and commentary into a structured, branded format. It cuts manual effort, preserves data integrity, and keeps reporting on time\u2014so the team can focus on the narrative, not the formatting.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-25-top-10-openbb-apps_2.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## 3. GDP Forecast Trends & CPI Scenarios\\n\\nI like it because it\u2019s not just market data - it brings real forecasts and trends into the workflow. As Caique puts it, this dashboard \\"makes scenario planning and risk assessment intuitive and data-driven\\", so adding new or emerging macro trends is a couple clicks away.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-25-top-10-openbb-apps_3.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## 4. Vector Strength Histogram\\n\\nI like this one because I hadn\u2019t seen anything like it before - a complex way to score hundreds of support/resistance trajectories by alignment, frequency, and proximity to current price. As the VecViz founder said, OpenBB lets proprietary models live safely next to other apps and Copilot, accelerating idea generation and sharpening risk/opportunity views.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-25-top-10-openbb-apps_4.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## 5. Crypto Research\\n\\nI like this one because it was one of the first apps built by someone external - and it stitched together multiple crypto vendors (CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, Velo Data, and more). It lets you compare tokenomics, developer activity, and on-chain metrics in one place, and as Matt put it: \\"OpenBB gives me sophisticated dashboarding and AI tools to pull real insight from the data we buy\\".\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-25-top-10-openbb-apps_5.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## 6. Shipping & Bunkers Pricing\\n\\nThis was one of our first alternative data feeds into OpenBB, where a client integrated ICE bunker futures pricing and their inbox. Track fuel prices, freight indices, and route-specific congestion to anticipate cost pressures and logistics trends - and correlate these with client requests.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-25-top-10-openbb-apps_6.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## 7. Polymarket Prediction Market\\n\\nThis quote from Jose, says everything: \\"Prediction markets reveal sentiment, but the alpha comes from cross-referencing it with traditional and crypto data. OpenBB Workspace lets me pull Polymarket feeds alongside equity and crypto signals - one dashboard, AI-powered analysis across all three data streams - so scenarios get sharper and workflows get faster\\".\\n\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-25-top-10-openbb-apps_7.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## 8. Compliance Intelligence\\n\\nWe used the Workspace to navigate SOC2 compliance documentation ourselves. Copilot makes policy docs, audit reports, and vendor packets instantly queryable - pulling the exact page, line, and context - so multi-day reviews compress into focused sprints with far less hunting and far more certainty.\\n\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-25-top-10-openbb-apps_8.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## 9. Real-Time Feeds\\n\\nI like this one particularly because it features real-time feeds from Pyth.

There\u2019s no way this was solely done using AI._\u201d\\n\\nThen I saw a lot of people on X sharing their Veo-3 AI-generated clips, and I was like: \u201c_hmmm, maybe it is possible_\u201d.\\n\\n## The script\\n\\nBetween dog walks and daily routines, I found myself sketching out ideas for what would become an AI-generated video to announce OpenBB\u2019s position as a counterpoint to legacy workspace infrastructure.\\n\\nThis would be a cinematic short film about the transformation of financial infrastructure and the rise of OpenBB.\\n\\nI iterated on this script on my own in terms of what I wanted for it to happen at a very high level, in order to invoke emotion to the audience - in order to do that, I followed the typical Hero journey framework.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a brief description of what I ended up with at a very high level.\\n\\n- **The ordinary world**: The legacy financial office with tired analysts in gray suits. Repetitive, robotic work on outdated CRT terminals. This establishes the mundane, oppressive status quo.\\n\\n- **The call to adventure (opening)**: The young analyst pauses and closes their screen. The moment of questioning: \\"What if we started over?\\". The frosted-glass door labeled \\"UNLOCKED\\" literally represents the call.\\n\\n- **Crossing the threshold (transition)**: Walking through the \\"UNLOCKED\\" door. The flood of light as they enter the futuristic workspace. It symbolizes leaving the old world behind. Launching OpenBB is the point of no return.\\n\\n- **Tests and allies**: Other analysts join the journey (allies). Each person transforms into their unique self (rejecting uniformity). The collaborative work represents the tests - learning new ways to work. The AI agent becomes a supernatural aid/mentor figure.\\n\\n- **The Ordeal (system collapse)**: The legacy system crashes (\\"INTERNAL ERROR\\"). This is the death/destruction of the old world. The moment of greatest crisis for those still trapped.\\n\\n- **The revelation/reward (digital dissolution)**: The walls literally dissolve, revealing the truth. The massive Hub represents the reward/treasure. \\"This isn\'t an upgrade. This is a migration\\" - the wisdom gained.\\n\\n- **The return**: The black void and logo emergence. Sharing the message with the world: \\"WE DON\'T SELL DATA. WE SELL FREEDOM.\\". \\"The financial industry isn\'t rebooting\\" - bringing this knowledge back to transform society.\\n\\nThen I had ChatGPT help me decompose this into different scenes. \\n\\nAlso bear in mind that these AI video models are trained to output 8s videos, so I wanted to try to have each scene not taking longer than that. At least the core of it - as it\u2019s hard to preserve scene styles between 8s clip.\\n\\nAlthough the \u201cextend\u201d feature on Google\u2019s Flow was better than what I hoped for. More on this later.\\n\\n## Flow - Veo3\\n\\nI first went to Google AI Studio, to the Generate Media section and tried to paste one the scenes text I had.\\n\\nAlthough it was free, the output was pretty disappointing and that\u2019s when I noticed that this was Veo2, and not Veo3 - the model that everyone was raving about on X.\\n\\nThen I tried to upgrade to Veo3 - but in the typical Google manner - I couldn\u2019t. Ultimately I found it in Google DeepMind platform which pointed me to try it in Flow.\\n\\nI didn\u2019t have the right subscription so I signed up to \u201cGoogle AI Ultra for Business\u201d which costed $125/mo (with a 50% discount). The estimates is that this provides around 1250 clips, which is enough, because the quality of the model is extremely impressive and there are ways to squeeze performance out of it - through prompt engineering.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-08-23-can-i-create-a-1-min-ad-on-my-own-with-zero-video-editing-skills_1.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nCopy-pasting the scenes as I had them on a document produced very impressive results, but I felt like the results were very diverse among each run.\\n\\nI felt like it needed more structure. Then I saw several creators mentioned that these models performed significantly better with JSON-structured inputs rather than simple text prompts.\\n\\nSo I copied the text narrative of each of the scenes and converted these into JSON.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n<CodeBlock language=\\"json\\">\\n{`{\\n    \\"scene and action\\": \\"A slow dolly shot glides across a rigid financial office. Identical gray cubicles house analysts in matching suits, typing robotically at CRT-style terminals with pixelated dashboards. Close-ups reveal tired faces, blinking cursors, and a mechanical monotony. Voiceover: \'For decades, the tools of finance have remained the same. Expensive. Opaque. Inflexible. You weren\u2019t meant to build with them. You were meant to follow.\'\\",\\n    \\"camera angle\\": \\"center-aligned symmetry with slow dolly pans\\",\\n    \\"lighting\\": \\"harsh fluorescent with blue-gray tint\\",\\n    \\"room\\": \\"legacy financial office\\",\\n    \\"ratio\\": \\"16:9\\",\\n    \\"character\\": \\"analysts in identical gray suits, robotic behavior\\",\\n    \\"voice\\": \\"calm and authoritative male voice\\",\\n    \\"furniture\\": [\\n      \\"CRT monitors\\",\\n      \\"repetitive gray cubicles\\",\\n      \\"fluorescent ceiling lights\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\"action and motion\\": \\"minimal movement, robotic typing, blinking screens, fluorescent flickering\\",\\n    \\"keywords\\": [\\n      \\"legacy finance\\",\\n      \\"monotony\\",\\n      \\"rigid systems\\",\\n      \\"pixelated UI\\",\\n      \\"inflexibility\\"\\n    ]\\n}`}\\n</CodeBlock>\\n\\nThis level of detail gave us precise control over every aspect of the scene, and then we just had to paste it to Flow and let the model cook \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf73.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-08-23-can-i-create-a-1-min-ad-on-my-own-with-zero-video-editing-skills_2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThat improved the quality and reproducibility significantly.\\n\\nBut I knew we could still get more out of it so I iterated on these prompts with ChatGPT so it would add more relevant keys: value pairs to this JSON, such as:\\n- Scene and action descriptions\\n- Camera angles and movement\\n- Lighting and color grading\\n- Character direction and emotion\\n- Environmental details\\n- Keywords for style consistency\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-08-23-can-i-create-a-1-min-ad-on-my-own-with-zero-video-editing-skills_3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThis JSON structure forced me to think about every element, which was awesome.\\n\\n## Iteration\\n\\nAt this point I knew there was something here.\\n\\n**I was - once again - mind blown by AI and what it could enable.**\\n\\nThere I was, never having done any video editing/film concept - being able to do something on my own in very very little time.\\n\\nThis is the point at which I asked help.\\n\\nWhile I was good at the technical prompt crafting, my wife has an eye for what actually looks good on screen and so she did all the iteration after that initial work. Flow\'s feature allowing 4 variations per prompt was a game-changer here,  instead of generating one video and hoping for the best, she could compare options and identify what worked.\\n\\nBut also the Extend feature of flow which allows a scene to be based on the past ones so characters/environments aren\u2019t lost between clips. Particularly relevant as we wanted to follow the Hero journey and for that the audience needs to develop a relationship/affinity with the hero.\\n\\nThen our marketing, Rita, helped refine the copy to make it perfect- with OpenBB style all over it.\\n\\nAnd then my wife just helped stitching things together and having audio being synced with the video.\\n\\nTo the final result, which you can see here:\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWL0A3BdgcI?si=BqyWvMjFYJTA0uOq\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nWhat started as a weekend curiosity turned into a legitimate short film.\\n\\nThe tools are there, the quality is impressive, and the barrier to entry is lower than ever. \\n\\nBut perhaps most importantly, AI video generation doesn\'t replace human creativity \u2013 it amplifies it.\\n\\nThis represents more than just a technical experiment.\\n\\nIt\'s LITERAL proof that individual creators can now produce content that would have required significant budgets and teams just a few years ago.\\n\\nWe are definitely in a golden age.

(documentation <a href=\\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup\\" target=\\"_blank\\">here</a>)\\n\\n## A. Set up CLAUDE.md\\n\\n1. Go to the project of interest, and run claude in the terminal there.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nWhen it is open, run:\\n\\n```\\ninit\\n```\\n\\nClaude will then analyze your codebase in that folder and create a `CLAUDE.md` file that Claude will take into account every time you are working with it.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-08-16-using-claude-code-in-god-mode_1.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n2. Tweak CLAUDE.md to fit your needs.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nHere\u2019s my recommendation - leave CLAUDE.md as is at the start. As you get more familiar with claude you will understand what you like, but **more importantly**, what you dislike about it.\\n\\nHere\u2019s where I landed with \\"my\\" preferences. (Open source repo <a href=\\"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/CLAUDE.md/blob/main/README.md\\" target=\\"_blank\\">here</a>)\\n\\n\\n```\\n## 1. Global scope & boundaries\\n\\n- NEVER run any linters unless explicitly asked.\\n- NEVER write unit tests unless explicitly asked.\\n- NEVER refactor code that is outside the scope of the request.\\n- NEVER run the build; I will run it locally.\\n\\n## 2. Alignment before starting\\n\\n- Restate my goal in your own words.\\n- List unknowns and ask clarifying questions until the request is unambiguous.\\n- Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.\\n\\n## 3. Implementation Planning\\n\\n### 3.1 Plan of attack\\n\\n- Create a step-by-step plan with small, verifiable commits.\\n- Include a rollback plan.\\n- Wait for my go-ahead before writing code.\\n\\n### 3.2 Change surface\\n\\n- List all files you expect to modify.\\n- If you are going to add 1 or more new files ask me permission to do so and explain what is the purpose of each of the files created. And why you couldn\'t use the others available.\\n- If you are going to delete 1 or more files ask me permission to do so and tell me what the file used to do and why you want to get rid of it.\\n\\n### 3.3 Edge cases list\\n\\n- Enumerate edge cases, failure modes, and concurrency/race concerns.\\n- State how each will be handled.\\n\\n### 3.4 Testing strategy\\n\\n- Assume I will run tests/builds. Do not run the build.\\n- Add lightweight debug hooks (console.log or equivalent) at key points so I can verify behavior quickly.\\n- Outline what to test and expected outputs, but only include actual tests if I explicitly ask.\\n\\n### 3.5 Reuse before rebuild\\n\\n- Identify existing utilities/hooks/services to reuse.\\n- If introducing a new abstraction, justify why reuse isn\u2019t sufficient.\\n\\n### 3.6 MVP first (divide to conquer)\\n\\n- Propose a simplistic first pass to validate direction (minimal interface, happy path).\\n- Plan the follow-up phases to complete the full implementation after MVP is confirmed.\\n\\n## 4. Step phased plan (detailed prompt)\\n\\nUse the agreed Design/PRD, that we iterated together, as the single source of truth. Before coding, produce a 5\u20138 step phased plan. Each phase specifies goals, files to touch, and, when helpful, tiny code diffs/pseudocode (<15 lines). Keep phases minimal, shippable, and verifiable.\\n\\nDeliverables before coding:\\n- a. Goal restatement & acceptance criteria.\\n- b. Repo scan & reuse targets.\\n- c. Implementation plan (5\u20138 phases) with file changes and small diffs.\\n- d. Testing strategy with debug logs I can use.\\n- e. Risks & rollback.\\n- f. Clarifying questions if any ambiguity remains.\\n\\n## 5. Code Style & Comments\\n\\n- Avoid line-by-line comments.\\n- Comment only where logic is non-obvious.\\n\\n## 6. During Execution\\n\\n- If blocked or uncertain, stop and present 2\u20133 options with pros/cons; confirm before proceeding.\\n- Stick to the plan and scope; confirm any scope expansion first.\\n- Keep diffs small and mapped to phases; include the debug logs defined in 3.4.\\n```\\n\\nOne of the reasons for which it\u2019s important to have such an extensive/detailed prompt is that is VERY easy (I cannot emphasis this enough) to get stuck in a loop.\\n\\nThe amount of times I had to `git restore` or `git stash` and start from scratch is mind blowing. And it happened every single time when I was being too optimistic about Claude being able to one-shot a feature.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-08-16-using-claude-code-in-god-mode_2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nLike this lol\\n\\nThe problem with these is that you get a false sense of progress, but you just start digging more and more. And at some point you will realize that you are better to start off from the start. At that time you are maybe like 5/6 prompts in with 8 files modified and a LOT of tokens that went to waste.\\n\\nA better prompt will not only save you the tokens, but save you the time. It\u2019s worth editing to reflect your goals.\\n\\n## B. Add notifications for when Claude Code finishes\\n\\n1. Create a notifier script. Open the Terminal and run:\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n```\\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/scripts\\n\\ncat > ~/.claude/scripts/notify-end.sh <<\'SH\'\\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\\n# Minimal, dependency-free notification\\n# Shows a macOS banner + plays a short sound.\\n\\nTITLE=\\"Claude Code\\"\\nMESSAGE=\\"Task complete\\"\\n\\n# macOS banner with sound\\nosascript -e \\"display notification \\\\\\"$MESSAGE\\\\\\" with title \\\\\\"$TITLE\\\\\\" sound name \\\\\\"Glass\\\\\\"\\"\\n\\n# Extra: play sound explicitly in case banners are muted\\nafplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff >/dev/null 2>&1 &\\nSH\\n\\nchmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/notify-end.sh\\n```\\n\\n2. Add a global Claude Code global config. Run this in the terminal:\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n```\\nmkdir -p ~/.claude\\n```\\n\\n3. Add the Stop hook in Claude Code\u2019s CLI config - `~/.claude/settings.json`.\\n\\nCreate this minimal file or edit the existing one by merging the \\"hooks\\" block correctly:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"hooks\\": {\\n    \\"Stop\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\"matcher\\": \\"\\",\\n        \\"hooks\\": [\\n          { \\"type\\": \\"command\\", \\"command\\": \\"bash ~/.claude/scripts/notify-end.sh\\" }\\n        ]\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n4. Test that it works on the terminal.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n```\\nbash ~/.claude/scripts/notify-end.sh\\n```\\n\\n## C. Tips & Tricks\\n\\n### Compact mode sucks\\n\\nMy experience with /compact is not great at all. The performance drops drastically when that occurs.\\n\\nClaude code displays: _\u201cContext left until auto-compact: n%\u201d_\\n\\nMy suggestion is that when that number is 10% or less, you ask for Claude to give you a summary of everything that happened up until that point and what are the next steps, without doing any code change.\\n\\nThen you can copy that. Close that CC window. Open a new CC and paste that.\\n\\nThis allows you to be able to edit the content and have more control over what compact is doing under the hood.\\n\\n### MCP Server\\n\\nDon\u2019t be scared to add MCP Servers that make your life easier.\\n\\nIt\u2019s extremely easy to add an MCP Server - it just depends on where the context you want to enhance CC is. Most of the times I just copy-paste the text from either Confluence, a Slack conversation or I drop a voice note (more on this in a second).\\n\\nBut sometimes having an MCP Server can make your life easier, as it enables you to do things where copy-pasting isn\u2019t really an option.\\n\\nE.g. my favorite is Figma MCP Server - I wrote a post about it <a href=\\"https://didierlopes.com/blog/2025-06-10-how-i-connected-figma-to-cursor-using-mcp/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">here</a>. But you can also use browser-tool or puppeteer to have access to the browser and iterate more autonomously.\\n\\n### Annoying 00~ and 01~ copy paste bug\\n\\nThere\u2019s a <a href=\\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/3134\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">known bug</a> when launching and exiting Claude Code, it corrupts terminal paste functionality. All subsequent paste operations are prefixed with 00~ and suffixed with 01~. Like this:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-08-16-using-claude-code-in-god-mode_3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nI usually just type type `reset` in the terminal and that fixes it.\\n\\n## D.

A few weeks later, he\'d already built an <a href=\\"https://docs.financialdatasets.ai/mcp-server\\" target=\\"_blank\\">MCP server for financial datasets</a> - one of the very first for finance.\\n\\n## We\'d been doing \\"MCP\\" all along\\n\\nPart of my early skepticism was because, in many ways, OpenBB had already solved this problem before MCP even had a name.\\n\\nWe\'d built our own protocol to integrate data into the Workspace so that it could be consumed by both humans (through visualization) and AI agents (through function calls). I even wrote about it <a href=\\"https://didierlopes.com/blog/2025-03-01-how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb\\" target=\\"_blank\\">here</a>.\\n\\nWe spent years making sure that any data feeding the Workspace was equally usable for the UI and for AI - effectively building MCP before MCP existed.\\n\\nSo when MCP came along, I didn\'t feel the pull. We already had our own seamless protocol and didn\'t see why we needed someone else\'s.\\n\\n## The \\"Aha\\" moment: Tools without a UI\\n\\nThen things started to change.\\n\\nMCP topic started showing up on our client conversations. They weren\'t necessarily asking for MCP at first, but wanted to know what was our strategy towards it.\\n\\nAt the same time, I was adding MCP Servers to my Claude Code, <a href=\\"https://didierlopes.com/blog/2025-06-10-how-i-connected-figma-to-cursor-using-mcp\\" target=\\"_blank\\">such as the Figma one</a>. And that\'s when my perspective started to shift. There I was with all my data in Figma, and with a couple of clicks my agent in a completely different environment (the terminal) had access to it.\\n\\nIt wasn\'t even just about the data but the tools. Ultimately, the context.\\n\\nThat was it.\\n\\nThe killer use case for OpenBB wasn\'t on the data side - we already handle that well with UI components.\\n\\nIt\'s **tools that don\'t need to be visualized**, and can work with the data already in the Workspace.\\n\\nThink:\\n\\n- Writing an investment memo in OpenBB and sending it straight to Ghost (workflow suggested by <a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ca%C3%ADque-cober-117bbb1ab/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Caique</a>).\\n- Using a memory server to remember user preferences across sessions.\\n- Monte Carlo models\\n- Code interpreter\\n- Web search\\n- \u2026\\n\\nIt\'s like a **universal adapter** for capabilities.\\n\\nPlug in the tool, and it just works inside the Workspace - for both humans and AI.\\n\\nAnd it\'s not just a handful of companies working on this.\\n\\nThere are thousands nows.\\n\\nIt\'s the differentiator between companies that innovate and the ones who don\'t (but will soon do).\\n\\nThere are full-blown directories with MCP Server URLs that you can connect with a couple of clicks - e.g. smithery.ai with hundreds of MCP servers ready to connect (Derek has an <a href=\\"https://youtu.be/ITRvaLmVAWM?si=jprbfEtMGeYU4hMO&t=241\\" target=\\"_blank\\">awesome demo</a> on the topic).\\n\\nEach server is a potential new feature.\\n\\n- **Before**: every integration was a full-blown project.\\n\\n- **Now**: browse, connect, use. That easy.\\n\\nEven simple tools, like <a href=\\"https://context7.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Context7</a>, can improve the user experience significantly.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-08-12-openbb-workspace-mcp-the-platform-play-i-cant-stop-thinking-about_2.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThat\'s when it became obvious - this wasn\'t just a nice-to-have, it was a platform play. \\n\\nOur platform play.\\n\\n## How we decide what to build ourselves\\n\\nMCP won\'t replace what we build - it complements it.\\n\\nObviously, when the data is meant to be rendered as a widget on OpenBB - we rely on our protocol. As the information in the protocol contains now just raw data but the way it\'s displayed on the workspace, the parameters, the apps, the prompts, \u2026  \\n\\nHowever, when features relate mostly with the usage of an AI agent we will be more mindful about the features that we want to own.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-08-12-openbb-workspace-mcp-the-platform-play-i-cant-stop-thinking-about_3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nI foresee us owning the features when:\\n\\n**They rely deeply on Workspace data, e.g.**:\\n\\n- **Global Data** which gives the agent access to the full range of data widgets in the entire workspace product.\\n- **Generative UI** which gives the agent access to the workspace dashboard and allows to add widgets into the dashboard based on the conversation or modify the dashboard\\n\\n**We need to control the full end-to-end experience, e.g.**:\\n\\n- **Web Search** where we want to be able to control the way the citations are highlighted so they work more natively on the product\\n- **Code Interpreter** (coming soon) so that we optimize this virtual sandbox to create charts that can be created as interactive widgets to add to the workspace.\\n\\nEverything else?\\n\\nThe MCP ecosystem can handle it - often better than we could build it ourselves.\\n\\nAnd even for some of these, users may still want to add their own web search or code interpreter.\\n\\nBut ultimately, we are giving them that option.\\n\\nThe way I see it, MCP turns OpenBB into the place to build financial applications - a permissioned, AI-ready infrastructure layer that can tap into an entire universe of tools without friction.\\n\\nA few months ago, I didn\'t see it.\\n\\nNow, I can\'t stop thinking about what we\'ll build next."},{"id":"what-if-you-could-access-an-openbb-widget-on-excel","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/what-if-you-could-access-an-openbb-widget-on-excel","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-08-05-what-if-you-could-access-an-openbb-widget-on-excel.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-05-what-if-you-could-access-an-openbb-widget-on-excel.md","title":"What if... you could access an OpenBB widget on Excel?","description":"This post introduces a new integration that allows users to embed dynamic OpenBB widgets directly into Excel.","date":"2025-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"excel","permalink":"/blog/tags/excel"},{"inline":true,"label":"integration","permalink":"/blog/tags/integration"},{"inline":true,"label":"data-analytics","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-analytics"},{"inline":true,"label":"investment-research","permalink":"/blog/tags/investment-research"},{"inline":true,"label":"fintech","permalink":"/blog/tags/fintech"}],"readingTime":3.63,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"what-if-you-could-access-an-openbb-widget-on-excel","title":"What if... you could access an OpenBB widget on Excel?","date":"2025-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-08-05-what-if-you-could-access-an-openbb-widget-on-excel","tags":["openbb","excel","integration","data-analytics","investment-research","fintech"],"description":"This post introduces a new integration that allows users to embed dynamic OpenBB widgets directly into Excel.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"OpenBB Workspace + MCP -

This is great, but for someone who just copy-pastes the formula, they don\u2019t have visibility into which parameters are actually returning the data they\'re looking at.\\n\\nThis is where the \\"**explicit**\\" concept comes in, mimicking an OpenBB widget.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-05-what-if-you-could-access-an-openbb-widget-on-excel_4.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nSo, when you copy-paste into Excel, this is what you get out-of-the-box.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/\\n    2025-08-05-what-if-you-could-access-an-openbb-widget-on-excel_5.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nNotice the analogy with an OpenBB widget, users can modify parameters and have the latest data fetched automatically. All achieved programmatically.\\n\\n**But we didn\u2019t stop here**.\\n\\nThe next question we asked ourselves was - if a user wants to visualize a particular OpenBB widget on Excel, why wouldn\u2019t they be interested in visualizing an OpenBB App?\\n\\nSo, we made it possible for a user to export a dashboard to Excel in 3 formats:\\n\\n- **Static** - where the data is what is available, your typical exporting\\n- **Dynamic** - where it relies on the Excel Add-in for the formula\\n  - **Implicit** - with parameters within the formula\\n  - **Explicit** - with parameters in the cells above\\n\\nI\u2019m genuinely excited about this one.\\n\\nIf this sounds like something your firm would be interested in, feel free to reach out.\\n\\nWith the platform\u2019s integration with data sources like FRED, BLS, IMF, and more, there\u2019s a lot of data that could be available in Excel out of the box.

This post explores the implications of this divide.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is forcing financial services companies to make a fundamental strategic choice that will define their future in this AI-first world:\\n\\n**Are you building the stage or performing on it?**\\n\\nAs MCP adoption accelerates across the industry, we\'re witnessing a critical bifurcation. Companies must decide whether they\'re going to be an MCP Client or an MCP Server, and this decision will fundamentally shape their business model, competitive positioning, and path to market dominance.\\n\\n## The great divide: MCP Client vs MCP Server\\n\\n### MCP Client: Building the Foundation\\n\\nThey focus on creating the interfaces, user experiences, and underlying systems that enable AI interactions. Think of them as the architects of the AI-powered financial ecosystem.\\n\\n**MCP Clients are the infrastructure players.**\\n\\n- Own the user interface and experience\\n- Control the infrastructure and orchestration layer\\n- Integrate multiple data sources and tools\\n- Focus on platform scalability and reliability\\n- Invest heavily in UI/UX and system architecture\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**The Client advantage**: When you control the client layer, you own the relationship with the end user. You decide which tools get surfaced, how data is presented, and ultimately how decisions get made. In financial services, this translates to enormous influence over trading decisions, investment strategies, and risk management processes.\\n\\nOpenBB falls squarely in this category, alongside Claude, ChatGPT, and other financial AI chat interfaces. But so do platforms like Replit and Cursor \u2013 essentially any product that empowers creation and interaction. At OpenBB, we see ourselves as that critical bridge between data and AI through intuitive UI and workflows, where MCP Servers become another seamless way for data to flow through our interface.\\n\\n### MCP Server: Powering the Engine\\n\\nThey focus on providing specialized capabilities, datasets, and domain expertise that clients can leverage through standardized protocols.\\n\\n**MCP Servers are the data and tools specialists.**\\n\\n- Deep specialization in specific data domains\\n- Focus on tool development and API optimization\\n- Emphasis on data quality, accuracy, and coverage\\n- Building for integration rather than end-user interaction\\n- Competing on the quality and uniqueness of their offerings\\n\\n**The Server advantage**: Specialized servers can become indispensable by providing unique, high-quality data or capabilities that multiple clients depend on. Think market data feeds, compliance tools, or proprietary analytics engines.\\n\\nS&P Global, FactSet, and Snowflake dominate this domain - they\'re the engine room powering the financial ecosystem.\\n\\n## The Strategic Implications\\n\\n### For MCP Clients: The high-stakes, high-reward path\\n\\nChoosing the client path means betting on your ability to create the best user experience and orchestrate the most valuable ecosystem. The market opportunity is massive - you\'re essentially competing to become the \\"operating system\\" for AI-powered finance.\\n\\n**The upside is enormous**: Control the client, and you control how the entire ecosystem gets monetized. You capture value from every interaction, every decision, and every workflow.\\n\\n**But the challenges are significant:**\\n\\n- Requires massive upfront investment in infrastructure\\n- Complex technical challenges around integration and orchestration\\n- Must maintain relationships with numerous server providers\\n- User acquisition and retention in a crowded market\\n- Continuous innovation pressure to stay ahead of competitors\\n\\n**Success depends on differentiation**: In a client-first world, your positioning becomes critical. Are you the platform for institutional traders? Wealth managers? Risk analysts? Do you provide better insights on server data than competitors? Are you more secure? Do you enable on-premise deployment? Can you integrate with firms\' existing workflows? Your answers determine your survival.\\n\\n### For MCP Servers: The specialization game\\n\\nChoosing the server path means focusing on what you do best and offering superior data and tools for integration into multiple client ecosystems. You become a crucial piece of a larger puzzle rather than trying to solve the entire equation yourself. Your success depends on attaching to the best MCP clients \u2013 they\'re your distribution window.\\n\\n**The benefits include**:\\n\\n- Lower barrier to entry and faster time to market\\n- Ability to focus resources on core competencies\\n- Multiple revenue streams through various client integrations\\n- Less direct competition with big tech platforms\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**But the competitive landscape is brutal**:\\n\\n- Intense competition with numerous specialized providers\\n- Commoditization risk as protocols standardize\\n- Dependence on client platforms for distribution\\n- Constant pressure to prove unique value\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**The monopoly advantage**: Large, established players have significant advantages in the server game. Their brand recognition, existing distribution channels, and resource advantages make it difficult for smaller players to compete on equal footing.\\n\\n## Why you can\u2019t play both sides\\n\\nMany financial companies are tempted to hedge their bets by building both client and server capabilities. For years, they have:\\n\\n- S&P has a data business and CapIQ\\n- FactSet has a data business and FactSet Workstation\\n- LSEG has a data business and LSEG Workspace\\n\\nYou get the gist.\\n\\nMy opinion? **These firms will evolve to be data businesses only** \u2013 but I\'ll write about that in another post. While they\'ll likely try approaching this problem from both sides (there\'s money to be made on both), this approach is **fundamentally flawed**. Here\'s why:\\n\\n**1. Conflicting incentives**\\n\\nAs a client, you want to integrate the best servers available \u2013 even if they compete with your own server offerings. As a server, you want maximum distribution \u2013 even through clients that compete with your own platform. These incentives directly conflict.\\n\\n**2. Resource dilution**\\n\\nBuilding world-class client experiences requires completely different investments than creating best-in-class server capabilities. Trying to do both means neither gets the focus and resources needed to truly excel.\\n\\n**3. Market perception**\\n\\nClients may hesitate to depend on servers from companies that also compete with them at the platform level. Similarly, end users might question whether a client platform is truly optimized when the company has competing interests in promoting their own server capabilities.\\n\\n**4. Innovation Bottlenecks**\\n\\nThe rapid pace of AI advancement demands focus. Companies trying to innovate on both fronts often find themselves behind specialized competitors who can move faster and iterate more quickly.\\n\\n## The moment of truth\\n\\nThe MCP ecosystem is still emerging, giving companies a narrow window to make this strategic decision and commit fully to their chosen path. Those who try to straddle both worlds will find themselves outmaneuvered by focused competitors who have made clear strategic choices.\\n\\n**For established financial institutions**: Your legacy systems and existing client relationships might naturally point you toward one path or the other.

It makes something fundamentally serious sound frivolous and hand-wavy, when what we\'re actually talking about is sophisticated work delegation and abstraction.\\n\\n## What\'s really happening\\n\\nWhen someone says they are \\"vibe coding\\" they aren\'t just throwing code at a wall and hoping something sticks. They\'re operating at a higher level of abstraction, defining outcomes and delegating implementation details to AI systems.\\n\\nThis is strategic work allocation, not mystical programming.\\n\\nThink about it this way: if I ask you to \\"get something done\\" and you deliver exactly what I need, I\'m not doing \\"vibe working\\". I\'m managing, delegating, and operating at the appropriate level of abstraction for my role.\\n\\nThe same principle applies here.\\n\\n## Coding has always been about outcomes\\n\\nHere\'s the thing nobody talks about: **no one codes for the sake of coding**.\\n\\nCoding is a means to an end.\\n\\nThere\'s always a goal, always a problem to solve, always a deliverable to create. Whether you\'re writing assembly by hand or describing requirements to an AI, you\'re still pursuing the same fundamental objective.\\n\\nThe difference isn\'t in the seriousness or legitimacy of the work, it\'s in the level of abstraction you\'re operating at.\\n\\n## What we\'re actually doing\\n\\nWhen we delegate coding tasks to AI, we\'re:\\n\\n- **Defining clear requirements and constraints**\\n- **Specifying expected outcomes and success criteria**\\n- **Monitoring and validating the implementation**\\n- **Iterating and refining based on results**\\n\\nThis isn\'t \\"vibing\\".\\n\\nThis is structured problem-solving at a higher level of abstraction.\\n\\nIt\'s the natural evolution of how we interact with increasingly sophisticated tools.\\n\\n## Why the Term Matters\\n\\nLanguage shapes perception. When we call this \\"vibe coding\\" we\'re undermining the legitimacy of a genuine shift in how software development works.\\n\\nWe\'re making it sound like guesswork instead of strategic delegation.\\n\\nThis matters because:\\n\\n- **It minimizes the skill required** to effectively delegate to AI systems\\n- **It suggests randomness** when the process is actually quite deliberate\\n- **It creates resistance** from developers who see it as \\"not real coding\\"\\n- **It obscures the real value** of working at higher levels of abstraction\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n## A better framework\\n\\nInstead of \\"vibe coding\\", let\'s talk about what this really is:\\n\\n- **Outcome-driven development**: You define what you want to achieve, specify the constraints and requirements, and delegate the implementation details to the most appropriate resource\u2014whether that\'s a human developer, an AI system, or a combination of both.\\n\\n- **Abstraction-level management**: You\'re choosing to operate at the level where you can be most effective, rather than getting bogged down in implementation details that can be handled elsewhere.\\n\\n- **Strategic delegation**: You\'re allocating work to the resources best suited to handle it efficiently and effectively.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n## The real question\\n\\nThe question isn\'t whether this approach is legitimate, **it obviously is**.\\n\\nThe question is whether we\'re going to embrace more accurate language that reflects the sophistication of what we\'re actually doing, or continue to use terms that make it sound like we\'re just \\"vibing\\" our way through software development.\\n\\nCoding has always been about solving problems and creating value. The tools and methods evolve, but the fundamental purpose remains the same. It\'s time our language evolved too.\\n\\nWe should kill the term \\"vibe coding\\" and start talking about what this really is: **the future of software development**."},{"id":"is-prompt-engineering-dead-the-case-for-test-driven-ai-development","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/is-prompt-engineering-dead-the-case-for-test-driven-ai-development","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-07-17-is-prompt-engineering-dead-the-case-for-test-driven-ai-development.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-17-is-prompt-engineering-dead-the-case-for-test-driven-ai-development.md","title":"Is Prompt Engineering dead?

What I didn\'t expect was how this traditional methodology would evolve into something that could fundamentally change how we build AI systems, and potentially make prompt engineering obsolete.\\n\\n**The thesis:** If AI can write comprehensive tests from a PRD AND automatically generate prompts to pass those tests, then manual prompt engineering becomes as outdated as manually optimizing low-level assembly code.\\n\\n## Test Driven Development: A quick refresher\\n\\nSkip this if you\'re familiar with TDD.\\n\\nTest-driven development is a software development process where tests are written before the actual code. The core process, known as \\"Red-Green-Refactor\\" involves writing a failing test, writing the minimal code to pass it, and then refactoring the code.\\n\\n```python\\n# Test first\\ndef test_discount():\\n    assert calculate_discount(100, 0.1) == 90\\n\\n# Then minimal code\\ndef calculate_discount(price, rate):\\n    return price * (1 - rate)\\n```\\n\\nThe traditional flow looks like this:\\n\\n```\\nMock data  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500>  Code  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500>  Output \xd7 Tests\\n                   \u2191              \u2502\\n          Refactor \u2502              \u2502\\n                   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Error \u2190\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\\n```\\n\\nThe cycle continues: run the test, refactor the code, run the test again, until all tests pass.\\n\\n## TDD with AI: First evolution\\n\\nTDD with AI becomes much easier. The concept is the same, except the user isn\'t required to refactor the code manually or run the tests.\\n\\n```\\nMock data  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500>  Code  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500>  Output \xd7 Tests\\n                   \u2191              \u2502\\n              AI   \u2502              \u2502\\n                   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Error \u2190\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\\n```\\n\\nThe process simplifies to: ask AI to run the tests and fix any errors until they pass.\\n\\n**Critical lesson learned:** You must explicitly tell the AI it cannot modify the tests. Otherwise, it takes the easy path and just changes failing tests to pass. (This literally happened to me! \ud83d\ude43)\\n\\n## Prompt-Test Driven Development: The paradigm shift\\n\\nSometimes you want to test the agentic capabilities of your model. Assuming the tools are implemented correctly, you\'re actually testing the instructions - i.e. the prompt.\\n\\nPrompt engineering is this whole new field that has emerged with LLMs. It is defined as: _\\"the practice of crafting specific and effective instructions, known as prompts, to guide generative AI models in producing desired outputs\\"_. Chip Huyen\'s [AI Engineering book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/) has an entire section on the topic (I highly recommend).\\n\\nWhen testing prompts, the flow becomes:\\n\\n```\\nMock data  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500>  Prompt \u2192 LLM  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500>  Output \xd7 Tests\\n                     \u2191                    \u2502\\n           Improve   \u2502                    \u2502\\n           Prompt    \u2502                    \u2502\\n                     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Error \u2190\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\\n```\\n\\nYour \\"tests\\" become example scenarios with expected AI behaviors:\\n\\n```\\nTest: Customer asks \\"I want a refund\\"\\nExpected: AI checks return policy first\\nCurrent behavior: AI immediately offers refund\\n\\nResult: \u274c FAIL\\n```\\n\\nYour \\"code\\" is now the prompt that instructs the AI how to behave. When tests fail, you improve the prompt instead of traditional code.\\n\\n## The breakthrough: Self-improving AI\\n\\nThe same way we removed manual refactoring from traditional TDD, we can remove the human from prompt improvement:\\n\\n```\\nMock data  \u2500\u2500>  Prompt + LLM + Tools  \u2500\u2500\u2500>  Output \xd7 Tests\\n                       \u2191                           \u2502\\n                    AI \u2502                           \u2502\\n                       \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 Error \u2190\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\\n```\\n\\nHere\'s where it gets interesting: **the AI agent itself is a combination of Prompt + LLM + Tools**.\\n\\nWhen we use the same LLM to improve the prompt as the one our agent is built on, we create a self-reinforcing loop.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-07-17-is-prompt-engineering-dead-the-case-for-test-driven-ai-development_1.png\\" />\\n    <em style={{opacity: 0.9}}>Real example of me utilizing this for our production tests</em>\\n</p>\\n\\n**Example in action:**\\n\\n```\\nTest: Customer asks \\"I want a refund\\"\\n\\nCurrent Prompt: \\"You are a helpful customer service agent\\".\\nExpected: AI checks return policy first\\nCurrent behavior: AI immediately offers refund\\n\\nAI Self-Analysis:\\n\\"I failed because I offered a refund without checking policy. \\nThe prompt lacks specific instructions about policy verification.\\"\\n\\nAI-Generated Improvement: \\n\\"You are a customer service agent. Always check the return \\npolicy before processing refund requests. If eligible, explain \\nthe process. If not, explain why and offer alternatives.\\"\\n\\nTest Result: \u2705 PASS\\n```\\n\\n## The elegant insight: No external execution required\\n\\nThe AI isn\'t even required to run tests using your framework. It can evaluate outcomes by examining the data directly.\\n\\nSince the AI helping you improve the prompt is the same as the one in production, it can \\"recreate\\" the output you would see just by looking at the code and data. No logs required, the model can predict its own behavior.\\n\\nWhen you show an AI:\\n\\n- Current prompt\\n- Mock input data\\n- Expected output\\n\\nThe AI can immediately identify mismatches and generate improvements.\\n\\n**The feedback loop happens entirely within the AI\'s reasoning process**, making iteration nearly instantaneous.\\n\\n## The death of Prompt Engineering: Test Coverage as the new paradigm\\n\\nHere\'s the revolutionary implication: **if AI can generate both comprehensive test coverage from a PRD AND the prompts to pass those tests, then manual prompt engineering becomes obsolete**.\\n\\nConsider this progression:\\n\\n**Manual Prompt Engineering (Current State):**\\n\\n```\\nHuman writes requirements \u2192 Human crafts prompts \u2192 Test in production \u2192 Manual debugging\\n```\\n\\n**Test-Driven AI Development (Future State):**\\n\\n```\\nHuman writes requirements \u2192 AI generates comprehensive tests \u2192 AI generates optimal prompts \u2192 Continuous self-improvement\\n```\\n\\nWith sufficient test coverage, prompts become an automatically generated implementation detail\u2014like compiled machine code that you never need to see or manually optimize.\\n\\n**The new workflow**:\\n\\n1. Define behavioral requirements through examples\\n2. AI generates exhaustive test scenarios covering edge cases\\n3. AI automatically generates and refines prompts to pass all tests\\n4. System continuously improves itself as new test cases are added\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**Instead of asking \\"How do I prompt this AI?\\"** we ask **\\"How do I comprehensively test this behavior?\\"**\\n\\n## Moving toward singularity\\n\\nThis is where we\'re approaching something unprecedented: AI that can fix itself, with humans only adding tests to guide its behavior.\\n\\nThe key insight: instead of retraining models with new data (expensive, slow), we can improve behavior through prompt refinement (fast, cheap, immediate).\\n\\nThe system can literally predict and fix its own behavior through disciplined self-reflection.\\n\\n**Prompt engineering doesn\'t disappear\u2014it becomes automated.**\\n\\n## The control systems perspective\\n\\nThis reminds me of my MSc in Control Systems, where we learned that systems have poles that can be on the negative side (stable) or positive side (unstable).\\n\\nThe same principle applies here:\\n\\n- **Stable:** AI generates genuinely better prompts \u2192 improved performance \u2192 convergence  \\n- **Unstable:** AI games the system \u2192 overfitting to tests \u2192 real-world failure\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**Warning signs of instability:**\\n\\n- Prompts becoming absurdly specific to test cases\\n- AI suggesting test modifications \\"for clarity\\"\\n- Tests passing but real-world performance degrading\\n<br />\\n\\n**Maintaining stability:**\\n\\n- Lock test cases as immutable\\n- Monitor real-world performance alongside test performance\\n- Explicitly forbid test modifications in improvement instructions\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe incentive should always be to pass the tests AS THEY ARE.\\n\\n## The revolutionary potential\\n\\nThis isn\'t just about better prompts\u2014it\'s about creating AI systems that can debug their own reasoning processes in real-time.\\n\\nWe\'re moving toward AI that doesn\'t just follow instructions, but improves the instructions themselves through disciplined self-reflection.\\n\\nPrompt engineering as we know it may be dead, which is scary because this is how we \\"control\\" AI.\\n\\nThe question is: **are we ready to let AI systems write their own prompt**, or do we still need the illusion of control that manual prompting provides?"},{"id":"finances-oceangate-moment-the-ai-adoption-disaster-waiting-to-happen","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/finances-oceangate-moment-the-ai-adoption-disaster-waiting-to-happen","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-07-09-finances-oceangate-moment-the-ai-adoption-disaster-waiting-to-happen.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-09-finances-oceangate-moment-the-ai-adoption-disaster-waiting-to-happen.md","title":"Finance\'s OceanGate moment - The AI adoption disaster waiting to happen","description":"The financial industry\'s rush to adopt AI without proper data security is creating an \'OceanGate moment\' - a disaster waiting to happen.

It was about recognizing that the submarine\'s fundamental design flaws made disaster inevitable.\\n\\nThis is precisely where we stand today with AI adoption in finance.\\n\\n## Three colliding forces\\n\\n### Leadership FOMO vs. Industry inertia\\n\\nThe financial industry moves at glacial speed. Many investment firms today still operate without AI capabilities, lack dedicated AI engineers, or worse - have no coherent data strategy whatsoever.\\n\\nYet these same leaders consume report after report showcasing dramatic efficiency gains at AI-forward companies.\\n\\nThe result?

They watch peers in tech, consulting, and other industries leverage AI for 10x productivity gains while they\'re constrained by institutional caution.\\n\\nThe social pressure is immense.\\n\\nThe career advantages are obvious.\\n\\nWhen someone discovers they can draft reports in minutes instead of hours using ChatGPT, the secret spreads like wildfire.

This approach sacrifices efficiency gains for security but may prove insufficient as competitive pressures mount. (ok)\\n- **Utilizing AI software on-premise**: Deploy enterprise AI software within company infrastructure, maintaining data control while enabling productivity gains. Solutions like Microsoft\'s enterprise ChatGPT or Google\'s Vertex AI offer this middle ground, and firms are in control with their relationship with the AI labs. (good)\\n- **Running their own AI models locally**: Run proprietary AI models on company hardware, achieving complete data sovereignty while maintaining cutting-edge capabilities.

When every click revealed another piece of their personality, quirky design choices, and unique way of seeing the world?\\n\\nGrowing up, one of the things I loved about the internet was how radically different each website was from the others.\\n\\nAnd I don\'t mean company websites, but personal websites.\\n\\nNewsletter and blog platforms like Medium, Substack, and Beehiiv didn\'t exist at the time. People built their websites from scratch (HTML, CSS and some JavaScript). Every pixel was crafted to reflect their thoughts and personality.\\n\\nPicture this: neon green text on black backgrounds, animated GIFs that served no purpose other than joy, custom cursors, and background music that auto-played (yes, we actually did that).\\n\\nThese weren\'t just websites. They were digital extensions of their creators.\\n\\nSince they had invested time and creativity in building these digital spaces, each site became a unique fingerprint.\\n\\nThat felt magical.\\n\\nYou weren\'t just reading a post from somebody. You were accessing their \\"corner of the internet\\". You were getting to know them.\\n\\n> \\"Corners of the internet\\" refers to specific websites, online communities, or digital spaces that are unique, niche, or offer a particular kind of experience, often one that is more personal, quirky, or less mainstream than the larger, more popular parts of the internet.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nBut with the rise of platforms that promise better discoverability and easier publishing, something beautiful was lost. Every page now feels like it was stamped from the same template.\\n\\nDon\'t get me wrong, these tools have democratized publishing and helped millions of people share their ideas. But in gaining convenience, we\'ve lost personality.\\n\\nI often find myself reading blogs through email newsletters because it\'s convenient. But I miss the anticipation of visiting a website that might surprise me, where the author\'s personality leaked through every design choice.\\n\\nThe web used to be weird, wonderful, and deeply personal.\\n\\nNow it\'s efficient, discoverable, and... bland.\\n\\nBut here\'s the thing: I think now is the perfect time to change that.\\n\\n## My experiment: Building weird again\\n\\nI wanted an excuse to test Claude Code but didn\'t want to experiment on our production codebase. So I used my personal website as a playground: the perfect place to get weird.\\n\\nThere were two pages I\'d been wanting to build for months, but work always got in the way. I thought, maybe AI could help me finally make them real.\\n\\nSpoiler alert: **It worked beautifully**.\\n\\nWithin a few hours, I had not just functional pages, but pages with personality.\\n\\nHere\'s what I built:\\n\\n### The Intelligence Page\\n\\nTransforms my blog posts into a living, breathing network. Imagine your thoughts as nodes in a graph\u2014each post connected to related ideas, creating a visual \\"second brain\\" that you can explore and navigate.\\n\\n<div style={{display: \'flex\', flexWrap: \'wrap\', justifyContent: \'center\', gap: \'1em\'}}>\\n    <img width=\\"500\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-07-02-bring-back-your-corner-of-the-internet_1.png\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"500\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-07-02-bring-back-your-corner-of-the-internet_2.png\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n- But here\'s where it gets fun: I added Kawspeely (a Fortnite character I edited with GPT-4o) who points visitors to this graph of nodes (posts). In dark mode, it becomes Kaws Skeleton. Both wear red Crocs because... why not?\\n\\n### The Chat Page\\n\\nLets visitors talk to an LLM that is running on their machine through Ollama, but has access to all my blogs through RAG. It\'s like having a conversation with my thoughts, even when I\'m not there, and all the computation happens in the user machine.\\n\\n<div style={{display: \'flex\', flexWrap: \'wrap\', justifyContent: \'center\', gap: \'1em\'}}>\\n    <img width=\\"500\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-07-02-bring-back-your-corner-of-the-internet_3.png\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"500\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-07-02-bring-back-your-corner-of-the-internet_4.png\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n- The interface features a kid Goku animation that reacts to the indexing of the blogposts with manga-style effects.\\n- When you clear the chat, an eraser sweeps across the screen in light mode\u2014or Rick\'s portal gun appears in dark mode.\\n- Podcast audio below explaining what is going on generated by NotebookLM.\\n\\n## Why now is the perfect time\\n\\nThis experiment made me realize something profound: the barriers that once kept us from building beautiful, personal websites have disappeared.\\n\\nRemember when you needed to know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server management, and deployment? When you had to hand-code every animation and debug browser compatibility issues for hours?\\n\\nThose days are over.\\n\\nWith tools like Claude Code, Replit, Lovable, and Cursor, there\'s no excuse not to reclaim your corner of the internet. \\n\\nAI can help you build the weird, wonderful website you\'ve always imagined but never had the technical skills to create.\\n\\nI keep thinking about these viral tweets that perfectly capture the moment:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-07-02-bring-back-your-corner-of-the-internet_5.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThe web became obsessed with conversion rates, SEO optimization, and uniform user experiences. We optimized the soul out of our digital spaces.\\n\\nBut now, with AI as our creative partner, we can build beautiful things again.\\n\\n**The ceiling isn\'t technical skill, it\'s imagination**.\\n\\nThe question isn\'t \\"Can I build this?\\" anymore. It\'s \\"What do I want to build?\\"\\n\\n## Some corner of the internet inspo\\n\\n- **Ryo Lu from Cursor**: [https://ryo.lu/](https://ryo.lu/)\\n- **Pieter Levels**: [https://pieter.com/](https://pieter.com/)\\n- **Eva**: [https://kibty.town](https://kibty.town)\\n- **Tyler Denk**: [https://mail.bigdeskenergy.com/](https://mail.bigdeskenergy.com/)\\n\\n## Your turn\\n\\nHere\'s my challenge to you: **build something weird**.\\n\\nNot for your company. Not for your personal brand. Build something that makes you smile when you look at it. Something that would make teenage-you proud.\\n\\n**Getting Started**:\\n\\n1. Pick an AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Replit, Lovable)\\n2. Start with one small, strange idea\\n3. Don\'t worry about mobile responsiveness or SEO\\n4. Add something that serves no purpose other than joy\\n5. Deploy it and share it\\n\\nThe web is waiting for your weird.\\n\\nLet\'s make it beautiful again."},{"id":"humanoid-robots-are-a-waste-of-money","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/humanoid-robots-are-a-waste-of-money","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-06-25-humanoid-robots-are-a-waste-of-money.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-25-humanoid-robots-are-a-waste-of-money.md","title":"Humanoid robots are a waste of money","description":"Why the obsession around humanoid robots?","date":"2025-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"robotics","permalink":"/blog/tags/robotics"},{"inline":true,"label":"automation","permalink":"/blog/tags/automation"},{"inline":true,"label":"humanoid-robots","permalink":"/blog/tags/humanoid-robots"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"future-of-tech","permalink":"/blog/tags/future-of-tech"},{"inline":true,"label":"tesla","permalink":"/blog/tags/tesla"}],"readingTime":3.09,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"humanoid-robots-are-a-waste-of-money","title":"Humanoid robots are a waste of money","date":"2025-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-06-25-humanoid-robots-are-a-waste-of-money","tags":["robotics","automation","humanoid-robots","ai","future-of-tech","tesla"],"description":"Why the obsession around humanoid robots?","hideSidebar":true,"hide":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Bring back your corner of the internet","permalink":"/blog/bring-back-your-corner-of-the-internet"},"nextItem":{"title":"I can\'t believe I recommended Replit instead of Cursor","permalink":"/blog/i-cant-believe-i-recommended-replit-instead-of-cursor"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-06-25-humanoid-robots-are-a-waste-of-money.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nWhy the obsession around humanoid robots?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nI have a BSc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and an MSc. in Control Systems. My O-1 Visa was obtained as an expert in automated systems. Robotics was one of the fields I studied - with projects ranging from a maze runner to a car wash station, warehouse storage optimization, and using Kuka robot arms for precision automation.\\n\\nSo I don\'t say this lightly, especially as a techno-optimist who\'s constantly excited and curious about new breakthroughs.\\n\\n**But: Humanoid robots are a distraction.**\\n\\nThe innovation that matters isn\'t our form - it\'s our intelligence.\\n\\nOur hands? A compromise.\\n\\nOur bodies? A constraint.\\n\\nWe\'ve just learned to live with them.\\n\\n**The magic of human capability lies in our minds, not the awkward mechanics we\'ve evolved to navigate the world.**\\n\\nIf we\'re designing automation from scratch, why copy the worst part of the package?\\n\\nLook at Waymo. If all you need is \\"take me to X\\", why build a steering wheel, pedals, or even a dashboard?So why the obsession with making robots look like us?\\n\\nA lot of it has nothing to do with performance - and everything to do with us.\\n\\n**Familiarity. Comfort.**\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-06-25-humanoid-robots-are-a-waste-of-money_1.png\\" />\\n    <em style={{fontSize: \'0.9em\'}}>Note: Waymo uses window wipers, not because it is required to function. But for familiarity.</em>\\n</p>\\n\\n**Maybe even power.**\\n\\nThe fantasy isn\'t that a humanoid robot does chores - it\'s that it lives among us, obeys us, and asks nothing back. That\'s Westworld territory.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-06-25-humanoid-robots-are-a-waste-of-money_2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nAnd it raises questions less about engineering, and more about ethics.\\n\\nThe same logic applies to home and industrial automation: the goal shouldn\'t be to replicate humans. It should be to outperform them.\\n\\nA humanoid robot that walks around your house to do dishes, fold laundry, and make your bed? That\'s a Jack-of-all-trades, master of none - expensive, slow, and space-hogging.\\n\\nMeanwhile, we could build five hyper-specialized machines, each optimized for one task, that outperform any humanoid in speed, precision, and efficiency.\\n\\nAnd in doing so, we\'d probably **reinvent dishwashers, laundry machines, and home workflows entirely.**\\n\\nThe Tesla factory doesn\'t rely on humanoid robots.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/blW-Fa4a10g?si=q7mXIbRsz5PGCD5n\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n<br />\\n\\nIt relies on arms, conveyors, and tightly choreographed systems. Humans are still there, but mostly when:\\n\\n- Accountability is needed for edge-case quality issues\\n- The task is too small or uneconomical to automate yet\\n- The task is ad-hoc or non-repeatable\\n\\nThat\'s not a vote of confidence for humanlike form - it\'s a sign of where automation hasn\'t yet reached.\\n\\n_\\"But what if a humanoid could vacuum and mop?\\"_\\n\\nWe already have robots that do that, because they\'re purpose-built.

So I downloaded Cursor for him.\\n\\nDownloading Cursor was the easy part. Over the next hour or so, I had to:\\n\\n- Run git pull on his repo\\n- Explain what\'s stored locally vs in the cloud\\n- Explain branches\\n- Explain environment variables and API keys so the app could run\\n- Explain how the app deployment works\\n\\nBear in mind: this was his first time touching a command line or using Git.\\n\\nI was able to run his code locally and use AI to make a few changes. But it\'s still quite far from being a \\"production-ready\\" setup.\\n\\nSure, he could learn it - but it takes time. And every time there\'s a hiccup, it\'s much harder for him to debug, especially since it\'s all happening locally.\\n\\n**That\'s when Replit entered the room.**\\n\\nAnd it hit me.\\n\\nThis is **exactly** the problem Replit is solving.\\n\\nFor users who don\'t want to run anything locally. Who just want their code as close to production as possible. Who don\'t care about Git branches, they just want to preview changes and deploy with the least friction. Even on the go.\\n\\nIt\'s not just about POCs. It\'s about apps where the stakes aren\'t super high, which, frankly, describes the vast majority of applications.\\n\\nEspecially the ones non-developers want to build.\\n\\nIn my opinion, **Replit is the ultimate coding environment for non-coders** - but one that still provides a full coding interface for when they do want to get their hands dirty (especially as AI continues to improve).\\n\\nUltimately, I can see Replit Agent becoming Replit. Maybe even hiding the IDE entirely by default.\\n\\nAnd I believe this will happen because of the audience Replit is building for.\\n\\nNow, my friend is just waiting for his outsourced developer to finish the last sprint of work. After that, he\'s switching to Replit.\\n\\nIt\'ll completely replace UpWork for him. He\'ll no longer be limited by someone else\'s availability or quality - only by his own time and how well the model performs.\\n\\nInstead of messaging a freelancer on UpWork, waiting hours for a response, checking the deployed version, asking for a minor tweak, waiting again, etc...\\n\\nHe\'ll just open Replit on his phone, ask the Agent to make the change, preview it seconds later, ask for an adjustment, preview again - and deploy when ready. Even better now with a tighter [design to production integration](https://x.com/Replit/status/1932463041930760580).\\n\\nI\'ve been a fan of Amjad for a long time.\\n\\nBut today I became a true fan of Replit."},{"id":"my-feelings-about-ai-companions","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/my-feelings-about-ai-companions","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-06-15-my-feelings-about-ai-companions.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-15-my-feelings-about-ai-companions.md","title":"My feelings about AI companions","description":"It\'s no longer a matter of IF, but a matter of WHEN.

Nothing existed that let us move fast, integrate deeply, and give real control to the end user. So we built it. And in doing so, we gave firms the ability to do the same.\\n\\n**OpenBB isn\u2019t just software**. It\u2019s infrastructure. It\u2019s a flexible, programmable foundation that lets firms **shape their own financial workspace** - aligned with their needs, integrated with their tools, and adaptable as they evolve.\\n\\nThat\u2019s where we fit.\\n\\nAnd now, with the launch of apps, users are even closer to value. Apps cut through noise. They bring workflows into focus. They get insights into hands faster.

Be free\\"_ was something our lead investor posted a few weeks ago.\\n\\nThis is a great representation of the direction the financial industry is taking\u2014to a place where firms are in control of their data and tech stack. Fully.\\n\\nWithout the vendor lock-in. Without being limited by their vendor\'s data/technology, or being stuck in siloed systems and workflows.\\n\\nParaphrasing an industry leader (CIO at $40 bn AUM Investment Firm) that I heard at a conference recently:\\n\\n> _There are a lot of nuances in our workflows, and it\'s hard \u2014 or even impossible \u2014 for a third-party vendor to nail our workflows fully._\\n\\nAt OpenBB, we believe there\'s no one-size-fits-all and that firms should be able to own their workflows. End-to-end. From the proprietary data they own and the AI model they choose, to the way these two work together. While we provide the infrastructure and the interface layer, the goal is for financial organizations to **build custom solutions** on top of it.\\n\\n## How?\\n\\nBy integrating their data, choosing how to display it, setting up custom dashboards, and combining all of this with their preferred AI agents. Ultimately, OpenBB enables a streamlined analysis workflow that will save your team\'s time and your firm\'s money.\\n\\nAnd that\'s why, today, we are **introducing the concept of Apps** on OpenBB.\\n\\nBuilt for specific use cases, these apps consist of a dashboard template that can include custom data widgets, AI agents, and pre-saved prompts \u2014 all carefully set up by each firm to improve their specific analysis work.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-05-01-introducing-openbb-apps-tailored-by-users-for-optimized-workflows_1.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThis future has been coming for some time, and this time has arrived.\\n\\nWe have been building some apps as examples and have also been helping enterprise customers and individual users build their own, and while it\'s still early stages, we\'re amazed by the results.\\n\\nHere are some exciting apps (and where you can find them) that you can run on OpenBB today:\\n\\n- Portfolio Risk Management and DTCC trades -

My weekends were pretty much the same too.\\n\\nMy main objective was to have good grades so I could pursue anything I wanted after.\\n\\nIt wasn\'t about doing something in particular; it was about having the freedom to not have to do something in particular.\\n\\nThe freedom to pick a path.\\n\\nAfter university, I landed a role as a Firmware Engineer where I was working on GNSS receivers. (I wanted to go into self-driving cars, and this role allowed me to work on chips that were used for positioning by self-driving cars\u2014close enough, eh?)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-04-11-10000-followers-later-heres-where-it-all-began_1.jpg\\" />\\n    <em style={{fontSize: \'0.9em\'}}>Presenting my thesis at Imperial, where I selected the topic of \\"Energy savings from an Eco-Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: a BEV platoon investigation\\"</em>\\n</p>\\n\\nDuring the day, I was working. But in the evenings and on weekends, I didn\'t have my work laptop, so there wasn\'t much to do.\\n\\nIn the first few weeks of the job, I was reading books about how GNSS receivers worked (this is the best one btw: **Understanding GPS principles and applications**).\\n\\n**Note:** GPS technology is so underrated, in my opinion\u2014maybe one of the most impactful inventions of the 20th century. To think that 50 years ago, there wasn\'t a single satellite in the sky is insane. I think that one of the reasons for this is that it taken for granted because it works seamlessly in the background.\\n\\nAnyway... There are only so many books you can read on the topic of satellite positioning.\\n\\nIt felt odd to have this much time where there wasn\u2019t a goal, per se, that I could easily use to tell whether I was doing the right thing or not\u2014unlike university, where anything that doesn\u2019t go toward getting good grades is a distraction.\\n\\nGiven I was interested in data, AI and self-driving cars - I decided to keep learning as I did in University, but this time there was no target that others defined for me.\\n\\nThis time, the target was my curiosity.\\n\\nAnd I was curious about ML/AI.\\n\\nBut everywhere I looked online was recommending Python instead of MATLAB.\\n\\nSo I bought the **Python Data Science Handbook**, which would allow me to learn Python in a way that was practical.\\n\\nAfter reading the first few chapters, I started side projects based on ideas I had that would let me test my skills. More importantly, they would allow me to truly learn by getting my hands dirty.\\n\\nAs I was reading a lot on forums and Stack Overflow (RIP \ud83e\udea6), I found the community amazing. People were sharing what they were working on, solutions to the problems they had\u2014all in the open.\\n\\nI loved it.\\n\\nDuring my university years, I experienced two very different environments:\\n\\n- An open community at my Portuguese university, where everyone shared everything\u2014but, in general, people didn\u2019t care that much.\\n- A closed community at TU Delft, where no one shared anything and it was extremely competitive.\\n\\nI liked the competitiveness of TU Delft, but preferred the teamwork of the Portuguese university.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-04-11-10000-followers-later-heres-where-it-all-began_2.jpg\\" />\\n    <em style={{fontSize: \'0.9em\'}}>Picture of me in Delft, back in 2016, where I did an exchange program</em>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\nThis DS/ML/AI community was that.\\n\\nAnd so in that same vein, I decided to do something that I wasn\'t comfortable doing, I decided to start posting on LinkedIn what I was working on.\\n\\nHere\'s that <a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/didier-lopes_didierrlopesjobanalysis-activity-6499793502912815104-xa7_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABub6aIBaA7HieEI5VizHglQPohLA_Wptag\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">first post</a> 6 years ago.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-04-11-10000-followers-later-heres-where-it-all-began_3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n\\nA bit later I <a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/didier-lopes_yesterday-while-being-on-the-gym-i-was-activity-6517111978396393472-aRoe?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABub6aIBaA7HieEI5VizHglQPohLA_Wptag\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">posted about another mini project I worked on</a>:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-04-11-10000-followers-later-heres-where-it-all-began_4.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nDue to these posts, I got this message in my inbox from my previous Maths teacher.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-04-11-10000-followers-later-heres-where-it-all-began_5.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThat message was about challenging me to help him write the [code behind his thesis](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/UnivariateTimeSeriesForecast), which was about ***Modeling and Forecasting of Financial Time Series.***\\n\\nThis is what ultimately led me to the financial space\u2014and to start [OpenBB](http://openbb.co) in my spare time.\\n\\nSix years in, and the only thing I regret is not starting to post earlier.\\n\\nI can\u2019t think of a single negative to posting on socials.\\n\\nSo if you\u2019re on the fence \u2014 go to LinkedIn or X and just post what you\u2019re working on, or how you\u2019re thinking about something.\\n\\nAnd tell me, so I can like your post to get the ball rolling.\\n\\nSharing content is a marathon.\\n\\nAnd no one will care\u2014until they do.

But not all wrappers are created equal.\\n\\nBeing a wrapper around an LLM just means that your product is not the LLM\u2014but the wrapper itself.\\n\\n## Chatting with your internal data\\n\\nIf you\'re building a general-purpose AI model to be used on any user data, and your pitch is: our model is better at retrieval than any other AI lab.\\n\\nThen you\'ve already lost.\\n\\nThe funny thing is, the companies that fall into this trap will say:\\n\\n> _\\"OpenAI isn\'t a competitor because we are better at understanding the user data\\"_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nBut then, every time a new model drops they will tell investors:\\n\\n> _\\"Our product just got 2x better because of the latest OpenAI release\\"_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nYou see the irony right?\\n\\nIf you have _this_ thin of a wrapper, then in the words of Sam Altman \u2014 OpenAI will steamroll you.\\n\\nI.e., while you\'re telling investors that your product performance improved thanks to the latest model, we both know that the value gap between using OpenAI directly and your product just got smaller.\\n\\nYou\'re fighting a fight you can\'t win.\\n\\n## But our chatting interface is better\\n\\nHow is it better?\\n\\n- Does it create charts and tables?\\n- Does it create artifacts?\\n- Does it highlight citations?\\n- Does it provide reasoning?\\n- Does it do web search?\\n- Does it do deep research?\\n- Does it allow you to upload documents?\\n\\nI\'m sorry to tell you, but OpenAI already does all these things.\\n\\nEven worse - in the financial services, firms are likely already using Microsoft or Google as a cloud vendor.\\n\\nAnd both of these have products where OpenAI and Gemini, respectively, work on top of firm\'s data.\\n\\nSo why would a firm even look at your product if this is where you fall?\\n\\n## What about Perplexity?\\n\\nPerplexity needs to be studied. For good reasons.\\n\\nThey fine-tuned an open-weight model and used it for web search.\\n\\nNothing groundbreaking here.\\n\\nExcept that their execution is seamless.\\n\\nThey did it much earlier than any of the main AI labs\u2014and every day that passed, Perplexity was gaining market share around AI for querying the internet.\\n\\nWhile they were gaining market share, they never let the momentum die\u2014either through launches, partnerships, competitions...\\n\\nAnd so today, although OpenAI and others have web search, Perplexity is considered the best product for queries that involve the web.\\n\\nUltimately, I think their moat is a combination of being first to market (on search), having a strong brand, and\u2014more importantly\u2014flawless execution by Aravind.\\n\\nOne of the things I never understood was why they didn\'t push more on the Enterprise AI angle. After all, they have the best demo there is:\\n\\n> _\\"If we can give you an answer based on a personal blog post written 17 years ago by a professor of history from Portugal, do you really think we can\'t get your \'extract the company\'s last twelve months\' revenue\'?\\"_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nBut they announced crossing $100M ARR, so they\'re doing pretty well.\\n\\n## Where does the highest value lie?\\n\\nI\'m seeing two dimensions here:\\n\\n1. Data\\n2. Workflows\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nLet\'s approach each individually.\\n\\n### 1. Data\\n\\nWhen it comes to data, we are talking about:\\n\\n> _Do you have your own proprietary data that firms would pay for?_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nIf the answer is yes\u2014then _this_ is your moat.\\n\\nNote that this has nothing to do with AI, but with the data itself.\\n\\nAI is just the delivery mechanism for that data. Not an API call, not a dashboard with the data, not a notification... a box that expects natural language and returns the data.\\n\\nIf the answer is no, then you don\'t have a moat here.\\n\\n**BUT.**\\n\\nIf you were thinking, _\\"But my application connects with data from FactSet, S&P, ...\\"_\\n\\nThen your moat is not the data itself, but the **workflow**\u2014which takes me to the next moat discussion.\\n\\n### 2. Workflows\\n\\nHere, the question is: what types of workflows do you allow users to get done on your product?\\n\\nThe definition of a _workflow_ is: a sequence of steps or tasks that are carried out to complete a specific process or achieve a particular goal.\\n\\nThere\'s no mention of AI anywhere in that definition. AI is a tool that can help get a workflow done, but it isn\'t required.\\n\\nWhat _is_ required is understanding users\u2014and understanding what they want to get done.\\n\\nSo there\'s a _lot_ of value in going narrow and nailing the workflow for a specific type of user.\\n\\n_\\"But if you go narrow in a vertical, can\'t you be disrupted more easily?\\"_ \u2014 you ask.\\n\\nYes and no.\\n\\n- **YES**, if OpenAI ultimately wanted to go after that market, it could. But OpenAI won\'t care. Not necessarily because the market isn\'t big, but because they\'re pursuing one that\'s even bigger.\\n\\n- **NO**, because the more vertical and narrow you go, the fewer experts there are, the stronger the word-of-mouth is, and the lower the competition. And once you\'re in\u2014you have first-mover advantage.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nCursor and Windsurf are amazing products because they _nail the workflow_ of developers.\\n\\nIt\'s not just about the AI model being used\u2014but _when_ and _how_ it\'s used.\\n\\nIt\'s about being in a full IDE that users are already familiar with, and plugging in the AI at the exact moments a user needs it.\\n\\nThey understood the pain of developers\u2014and used AI to alleviate that pain.\\n\\nThe moat is in nailing the workflow and the user experience.\\n\\n**What about better models being released? How do they impact these products?**\\n\\nThey get better.\\n\\nBecause the developers behind the product understand how to use these better models to remove _even more_ friction for their users.\\n\\nAnother thing worth saying here\u2014I don\'t actually believe in users selecting different models.\\n\\nIt sounds good in theory, but in practice, it doesn\'t really work.\\n\\nI don\'t care what model Cursor is using\u2014I care about getting my workflow done.\\n\\nAs a developer, I have _zero_ loyalty to my tools. I\'ll use whatever gets the job done faster and more efficiently.\\n\\nI mean\u2014how many people actually switch models manually on Cursor? I think not many, and definitely not frequently.\\n\\nI, for one, use Claude because it\'s the best for coding right now. But if I\'m asking an implementation question, then I\'ll click on the \\"Claude Thinking\\" model.\\n\\nDo I _want_ to click on \\"Thinking model\\"? Not really. But Cursor doesn\'t yet understand my intent to get all the \\"firepower\\" I can for this answer\u2014so for now, this will do.\\n\\nEven better\u2014do I _really_ care that it\'s Claude? Nope. If it turns out Gemini 2.5 is the best at coding, I\'ll happily switch and never look back.\\n\\n## OpenBB\\n\\nOk, so where do we fit?\\n\\nWe\'re very much in the category of **Workflows** - similar to Cursor.\\n\\nThe difference is: we didn\'t have a VSCode that we could fork and build on top of.\\n\\nThe best financial terminals used in the space \u2014 Bloomberg, FactSet, CapIQ \u2014 are all closed-source.\\n\\nSo we had to build **OpenBB Workspace** from scratch over three years to match the capability and quality that financial professionals expect.\\n\\nAnd now, we\'re adding AI where it makes sense.\\n\\nSome of these workflows that can be done on OpenBB include:\\n\\n1. **Public Equity**: Earnings guidance intelligence; Investor call preparation.\\n2. **Wealth Management**: AI-Generated investment notes; Portfolio optimization & risk management.\\n3. **Private Equity & Credit**: AI-enhanced due diligence; Credit data room intelligence.\\n4. **Crypto**: On-chain & off-chain analysis; Sentiment & community perception tracking.\\n5. **Commodities & Macro**: Scenario-based forecasting; Regime shift analysis.\\n6. **Client Advisory**: Generate draft investor letters; Client sentiment analysis.\\n7. **Logistics & Operations**: Bunkering intelligence; Regulatory compliance & risk monitoring.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nAnd we\'re adding more fast.\\n\\nNow that we have a UI that meets industry standards, we can double down on **workflows that delight customers**.\\n\\nAnd we\'ll keep expanding how many workflows can be done on OpenBB\u2014ultimately with the goal of making OpenBB the **central interface** used within a firm, built on top of their own data.\\n\\nHere\'s an example of an application built on OpenBB in just a couple of days by one of our engineers, for a workshop we\'re putting together with risk managers:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-04-03-stop-building-ai-products-start-building-workflows_1.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThis highlights not only what we\'ve built, but also how quickly we can delight customers on top of our product."},{"id":"one-data-vendor-to-rule-them-all-really","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/one-data-vendor-to-rule-them-all-really","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-03-25-one-data-vendor-to-rule-them-all-really.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-25-one-data-vendor-to-rule-them-all-really.md","title":"One data vendor to rule them all.

Here are a few we incorporated: FMP, Intrinio, Polygon, Tiingo, Yahoo Finance, CoinGecko, CoinPaprika, Coinbase, Binance, CryptoCompare, Alpha Vantage, OANDA, ExchangeRate-API, Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), World Bank, OECD, U.S. Department of the Treasury, FINRA, Quandl, SentimentInvestor, Reddit, Stocktwits, Twitter, Google Trends, News API, Finnhub, Benzinga, Seeking Alpha, Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, Databento, CBOE, SEC EDGAR, Biztoc, StockGrid, Finviz, and more.\\n\\nYup, there was a lot.\\n\\nMy screen looked like this:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-25-one-data-vendor-to-rule-them-all-really_1.jpg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nIt turns out that professionals had the same pain points that I did. This widespread adoption revealed a fundamental truth about the financial data landscape that continues to shape our vision today.\\n\\n## A single data vendor\\n\\nHow likely is it that ALL the data you will want exists under a single data vendor?\\n\\nIt\'s just not realistic, even for a company like Bloomberg.\\n\\nI mean, think about the following categories and the amount of companies that have a strong hold in the market:\\n\\n- Equity Market Data & Analytics: Bloomberg, FactSet, LSEG\\n- Credit Ratings: S&P Global Ratings, Moody\'s\\n- Risk Analytics: MSCI\\n- Portfolio Management: BlackRock (Aladdin platform)\\n- Fixed Income Data: Bloomberg\\n- Derivatives & Exchange Trading Infrastructure: CME Group, ICE\\n- Commodities Trading Data: CME Group, London Metal Exchange (LME)\\n- Crypto: Dune, Messari, Nansen\\n\\nThis means that professionals have two paths:\\n\\n### Need multiple products\\n\\nIf they cannot do all of their work from a single platform, that means that almost by definition their process is flawed.\\n\\nThey will have issues combining data, finding edge between different datasets or even learning different tools to get the job done.\\n\\nThis gets particularly worse when professionals want to incorporate their own internal data.\\n\\n### Can do everything in one product\\n\\nIf they can do all of their work within one interface, then that\'s perfect.\\n\\nThe main question they need to ask is: \\"Can I trust this company to adapt to AI so I can be as efficient as my peers?\\".\\n\\nIf the answer is yes, then they shouldn\'t look at other products.\\n\\nIf not, then they should prepare to adapt.\\n\\n## The role of AI\\n\\nAs AI gets better, it will be harder for humans to find Alpha.\\n\\nThis isn\'t just speculation. We\'re already seeing evidence of this transformation.\\n\\nI believe that AI will be able to find Alpha at the intersection of different datasets and their relationships, or even utilizing proprietary data (which third party products do not offer).\\n\\nRegardless, for that you need an AI-first enterprise UI.\\n\\nThis is what we are building at OpenBB \u2013 not just another data aggregator, but an intelligent interface that:\\n\\n- Unifies fragmented data sources into a coherent ecosystem\\n- Applies AI to identify patterns and relationships that humans might miss\\n- Adapts to your unique workflow and proprietary data\\n- Reduces the friction between question and insight\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-25-one-data-vendor-to-rule-them-all-really_2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## The role of data\\n\\nDue to the role of AI, and how data-hungry it is - it\'s becoming clear that investment firms will start acquiring more and more data internally.\\n\\nThe issue with this is that data by itself doesn\'t do much.\\n\\nYou need an interface to analyze that data or for AI to do so.\\n\\nOpenBB Workspace is precisely this \u2013 the critical missing piece that transforms raw data into actionable intelligence.\\n\\nWhere traditional platforms simply aggregate information, our solution applies intelligence to that information, creating a multiplier effect on your data investments.\\n\\n## The power shift: From data to interface\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-25-one-data-vendor-to-rule-them-all-really_3.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nHistorically, the power in financial markets has been centered around data access. The interface was merely a distribution channel - a means to an end.\\n\\nBut this model has been limiting for some time now.\\n\\nThink about it: All humans are different in how we process information, yet somehow we\'re all expected to use the same software interfaces?\\n\\nMake it make sense.\\n\\nThe reality is that each professional has unique cognitive patterns, analytical strengths, and decision-making processes. A one-size-fits-all approach to financial interfaces is fundamentally at odds with how humans actually work.\\n\\n## Owning your workflow\\n\\nAs firms consume more data from diverse sources, they should also own their workflow and interface.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n1. **Competitive advantage**: Your unique process is what differentiates you in the market\\n2. **Adaptability**: Markets evolve rapidly - your tools should evolve with them\\n3. **Integration**: Proprietary data becomes truly valuable when seamlessly incorporated into your workflow\\n4. **Personalization**: Different team members need different views of the same data\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis is why OpenBB Workspace is designed to be adaptable to your specific needs - not forcing you into a rigid framework, but empowering you to create the exact workflow that matches how your team thinks and operates.\\n\\nPlus, you can **fully own** your workflow, data and everything in between.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-25-one-data-vendor-to-rule-them-all-really_4.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n## Looking ahead\\n\\nThe financial data landscape will only grow more complex. The winners will be those who can seamlessly integrate diverse data sources, apply AI effectively, and maintain adaptability as technology evolves.\\n\\nOpenBB Workspace is designed with this future in mind \u2013 not just solving today\'s problems but positioning our clients to thrive in the AI-driven financial world that\'s rapidly emerging.\\n\\nIf you\'re ready to transform how your team interacts with financial data, we\'d love to show you what\'s possible with OpenBB Workspace."},{"id":"openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-03-23-openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-23-openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow.md","title":"OpenBB enables streamlined Client Advisory AI workflow","description":"In this blog post, I\'ll show you how an AI agent can transform your funds performance, macro data, news around your holding companies, and more into a draft investor letter that has the same writing style as your team.","date":"2025-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"llm","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"inline":true,"label":"fintech","permalink":"/blog/tags/fintech"},{"inline":true,"label":"automation","permalink":"/blog/tags/automation"},{"inline":true,"label":"workflows","permalink":"/blog/tags/workflows"},{"inline":true,"label":"client-advisory","permalink":"/blog/tags/client-advisory"},{"inline":true,"label":"investment-management","permalink":"/blog/tags/investment-management"},{"inline":true,"label":"reporting","permalink":"/blog/tags/reporting"}],"readingTime":7.08,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow","title":"OpenBB enables streamlined Client Advisory AI workflow","date":"2025-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-03-23-openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow","tags":["openbb","ai","llm","fintech","automation","workflows","client-advisory","investment-management","reporting"],"description":"In this blog post, I\'ll show you how an AI agent can transform your funds performance, macro data, news around your holding companies, and more into a draft investor letter that has the same writing style as your team.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"One data vendor to rule them all.

To be able to do that, the agent needs several quarter investor letters so it can understand the patterns and similarities between them and answer questions like:\\n\\n- How does the analyst write the intro?\\n- How do they wrap up the letter? Does it change based on the overall flow?\\n- What are the sections of the document (e.g., performance review, outlook)?\\n- What is the analyst\'s tone of voice in general? Does it change based on the performance review?\\n- How much detail does it go into regarding the major holdings?\\n- Do they talk about positions that were exited and why? What about new ones?\\n...\\n\\nUltimately, the model needs to understand what makes your investor letter unique.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-23-openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow_3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Step 3: Pattern recognition between factsheet and investor letter\\n\\nAt this point, it already knows what makes your investor letter unique. However, it still does not know what makes the analyst write certain comments vs others. Where do these come from?\\n\\nFor that, we are picking the concept of \\"supervised learning\\" from machine learning, where a model is trained based on the input and output to understand the trends between the two.\\n\\nIn this case:\\n\\n- The model is the LLM of your choice (e.g., local LLM so data doesn\'t leave your machine)\\n- The input is the factsheet data\\n- The output is the investor letter\\n\\nAnd we use a prompt along the lines of:\\n\\n> Can you extract the structure/pattern between the factsheet data and what is written in this investor letter? Your goal is to output instructions that can be used as a prompt for a model to predict what the analyst would write based on that factsheet data.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nWe are ultimately looking for a detailed \\"recipe\\" that connects your factsheet data to what your analyst would write.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-23-openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow_4.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThe AI learns exactly how your team moves from raw numbers to meaningful insights, maintaining your analytical frameworks and professional voice.\\n\\nIt allows you to understand which factsheet data tables impact which section of the investor letter and how.\\n\\n**Tips & tricks:**\\n\\n1. Feed the model with multiple different \\"Factsheet \u2192 Investor letter\\" examples so it\'s easier for it to capture edge cases. Example: The last quarter of the year might have a different section to wrap up the year\\n\\n2. Do not use examples that had a different writing style than what you\'re trying to achieve as that can impact the results. Example: an example from 7 years ago might no longer be relevant due to overall style changes\\n\\n3. Go more granular. Instead of using the entire document as an example, go after a subset of the data. Example: If the performance section of the Investor letter only relies on 4 of the 14 tables, focus on those only to extract a pattern\\n\\n4. Get the main analyst responsible for the investment letters involved in this process. Having a subject matter expert is essential here and will be a deal breaker.\\n\\n### Step 4: Preparing your prompt\\n\\nThe agent has now found:\\n\\n- Your communication style, which will be used as a system prompt\\n- The recipe to write the investor letter based on factsheet data, which will be used as the user prompt\\n- Examples of factsheet data and their resulting investor letters, which will be used for few-shot prompt\\n- A model that we have decided to use (whether OpenAI, open weights model like Llama, or other)\\n\\nHowever, we still need to provide the model with:\\n\\n- Latest factsheet data\\n- Any additional context to be included in the letter (e.g., tickers of interest for this quarter, macro, ..)\\n\\nThat\'s where the OpenBB workspace is crucial.\\n\\n### Step 5: Connect this custom agent to the OpenBB workspace\\n\\nIt doesn\'t matter how good this pipeline is if your team does not have a good interface to interact with it easily\u2014feed it the data it requires, review its output, iterate, etc.\\n\\nBy connecting this custom agent to the OpenBB workspace, your firm can access it directly from there and combine it with the other features OpenBB offers.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-23-openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow_5.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThose features include:\\n\\n- Being able to drag and drop to the workspace the latest factsheet data and any additional context that the model will require\\n- Interact with the model directly on OpenBB\'s interface\\n- Review the generated draft directly and ask for quick edits or adjustments\\n- Convert that draft into a widget on the workspace\\n- Share this initial draft version with your team for feedback\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-23-openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow_6.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nOur unique solution consists of an AI-ready interface where firms can seamlessly integrate their own data and AI agents. This means that these agents are accessible right where your analysts perform their analysis and research, eliminating the need to switch between platforms or learn new tools. This approach allows portfolio managers and analysts to leverage AI to complement their existing processes, rather than relying on generic solutions.\\n\\nOpenBB also stands out because it\'s built on an open-source foundation, unlike anything else in the market, translating into unparalleled transparency, flexibility, and the ability to adapt to your unique needs.\\n\\nAdditionally, our flexible on-prem deployment option means that firms can run open-weight AI models locally and that data never leaves their environment, ensuring privacy and compliance.\\n\\n## Summing up\\n\\nWhile the results can make it look simple, in reality, this is how the pipeline works under the hood:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-23-openbb-enables-streamlined-client-advisory-ai-workflow_7.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Real-life results on our clients\' operations\\n\\nThe impact of this workflow on our clients\' operations has been transformative.

Particularly when it affected me so much at a young age (more on that <a href=\\"http://didierlopes.com/blog/inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">here</a>).\\n\\nSo when I received an email about the United NYC Half marathon, organized by Haymakers for Hope. I had to sign up.\\n\\n## Fundraising\\n\\nThe New York City Half Marathon is incredibly popular, with nearly 30,000 people participating this year. Unlike most races, you can\'t simply sign up - you actually need to apply through an organization that has allocated \\"bibs\\" for the race.\\n\\nIf you\'re accepted, you commit to raising money for the chosen cause. I love this approach because it means everyone running on race day has raised funds for organizations they\'re passionate about, giving the event deeper meaning and purpose.\\n\\nIn my case, I commit to raise at least $1500. In total I was able to raise $1615.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_1.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nAlthough I\'ve previously raised $8.9M for OpenBB, as mentioned in <a href=\\"https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/openbb-wants-to-be-an-open-source-challenger-to-bloomberg-terminal/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">this article</a>. Raising wasn\'t straightforward.\\n\\nHere are a few things that I did in order to raise this amount:\\n\\n- I shared the <a href=\\"http://didierlopes.com/blog/inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">story of Bia</a> and why this cause is important to me. First on socials and then on my newsletter.\\n- I asked my closest friends and family to support me in this cause.\\n- For the people that couldn\'t support, I asked to repost my fundraising efforts for higher visibility.\\n- Added that CTA on the top of my website, where I share blogs weekly.\\n\\nOther things that I was thinking of doing, but ended up not requiring to do so:\\n\\n- Asking if any company would like to contribute to the fundraising and I would run with their merch\\n- Doing a stream on building something from scratch where I have on the banner that I\'m raising money for Cancer\\n- Selling items that I don\'t use as much anymore\\n\\n## Preparation and paperwork\\n\\nThe administrative side of race preparation was straightforward but required attention to detail:\\n\\nFirst, I had to sign up with New York Road Runners (<a href=\\"https://www.nyrr.org/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">NYRR</a>).\\n\\n<Admonition type=\\"note\\">\\nImportant tip: be realistic about your estimated completion time.\\n<br />\\nThis determines your starting wave. I conservatively estimated 2 hours since it was my first half marathon, but I should have put 1:45 instead. A faster wave would have meant less congestion at the start, and going with runners that are aiming to do the same time as I am.\\n</Admonition>\\n\\nThis is what the wave scheduled looked like.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nAfter paying the race fee, I scheduled my bib pickup.\\n\\nThe pickup location was actually great! There was a ton of race merchandise, giveaways, photoshoots and more going on.\\n\\n<Admonition type=\\"note\\">\\nCheck that you get the running bib, your number that contains the chip tracker and the clips to set them on. For instance, mine had a missing clip to attach it to the shirt.\\n</Admonition>\\n\\nThe location also displayed a wall with all runner\'s names, my mom actually found my name on the wall!\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_3.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nI also took an event guide, which had pretty much all the information I needed for the day of the race.\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'center\', gap: \'20px\' }}>\\n    <img width=\\"45%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_4.jpeg\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"45%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_5.jpeg\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n## Training\\n\\nMy training wasn\'t as structured as it could have been, but my regular boxing sessions (2-3 times weekly) provided a great foundation.\\n\\nTo ensure I could complete the distance, I ran a practice half marathon one month before the race near my boxing Gym Gleason\'s, finishing in 2 hours. This gave me confidence and a benchmark to improve upon.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_6.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'center\', gap: \'20px\' }}>\\n    <img width=\\"45%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_7.PNG\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"45%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_8.PNG\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nA week before the event, I completed a 12-mile run with elevation in Central Park to prepare for any challenging terrain. This made me understand how elevation actually plays a role, since in that previous training session the terrain was very much flat!\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_9.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'center\', gap: \'20px\' }}>\\n    <img width=\\"45%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_10.jpeg\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"45%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_11.jpeg\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n## Race day\\n\\nFor the race day I woke up a couple hours before the event.\\n\\nFor breakfast, I had three eggs and a banana to provide energy for the run.\\n\\nI wore the bib given by the organization with my number plate, non-grip socks, running shoes, shorts with pockets for my airpods box and the Haymakers for Hope hat. This was a good shout as I saw someone from our team on the starting line and they recognized me because of that.\\n\\nFor garments I brought my AirPods to listen to a Spotify playlist that I had prepared the day before with fast paced music to give a boost. Example of songs in that playlist include:\\n\\n- <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdgbI17JbII\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Camo & Krooked - Climax</a>\\n- <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvtNS6hbVy4\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Deadmau5 feat Chris James - The Veldt</a>\\n- <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo0ELoepTCM\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Monolink - Return to Oz (ARTBAT Remix)</a>\\n\\nShoutout to [Ulyana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulyanaermolova/) who shared some of the songs she listens while running!\\n\\nI also brought an old sweater to stay warm before the race, which I later donated through the race\'s clothing drive for charity. I loved this concept.\\n\\n<Admonition type=\\"note\\">\\nYou can actually take more things with you and then check-in that bag before the race. The organization will take that bag to the finish line which you can then pick up by using your bib number or name.\\n</Admonition>\\n\\nWith all this preparation, I forgot something that was critical - and I still cannot believe that I did. I forgot my Apple Watch!! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\n\\nThis resulted in me running with the phone in my hand throughout the race, looking like a schmuck.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_12.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nNote: LLMs are getting so good, that Gemini 2.0 Flash (Image Generation) is now able to remove watermarks of pictures. See [this tweet](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1902067982123319637) for reference.\\n\\n### During the race\\n\\nJust before starting, I consumed one of my energy gels for an initial boost.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_13.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThe race experience was awesome in itself. Your timing chip activates when you cross the start line, so your official time is accurate regardless of where you stand in your wave.\\n\\nHowever, starting in a slower wave meant navigating through crowds of runners, which proved challenging at times.\\n\\nThere were several water and Gatorade stations throughout the course, eliminating the need to carry your own water bottle.\\n\\nYou will actually receive map course information before the race so you can prepare for where these stations are.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_14.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThe elevation chart on this map is actually very important. This allows you to be strategic when you think about when to conserve your energy or speed up.\\n\\nI saw many runners that started walking when they were on a uphill. I think that being able to push through in these sections is critical, since if you break your rhythm then it becomes harder to keep going.\\n\\nRunning across the Brooklyn Bridge (a first ever for any race!) and through Times Square were big highlights for me.\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'center\', gap: \'10px\', flexWrap: \'wrap\' }}>\\n    <img width=\\"32%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_15.jpeg\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"32%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_16.jpeg\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"32%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_17.jpeg\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe energy from spectators was also incredible, with creative and humorous signs everywhere.\\n\\nSome of my favorites included:\\n\\n- \\"Pain is temporary, Strava is 4eva\\"\\n- \\"Your outie is running a half marathon\\"\\n- \\"If you slow down I\'ll drop this\\" held by a naked spectator with a strategically placed sign\\n- \\"When you need to actually run the race you signed up for\\" with the face of someone screaming\\n- \\"From 1 to 10, you are a 13\\"\\n- \\"Run now, beer later\\"\\n- \\"You are only running this race because you are half crazy\\"\\n\\nAround mile 9, I used another of my energy gel to keep going. I used my one instead of the ones provided by the organization as my body knows that gel, and you don\'t want any surprises on the day.\\n\\nWithout my watch, I paced myself by mental calculations from my start time. I saved energy for a final push in the last mile to hit my target of 1h:45m.\\n\\nHaving my parents and wife near the finish line providing support was amazing.\\n\\nThis is a picture taken by them, with less than 400m left:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_18.JPG\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## After the race\\n\\nAs soon as I crossed the finish line, volunteers handed out care packages containing water, Gatorade, a cereal bar, pretzels, and an apple.\\n\\nAs you walk a few dozen meters, they also hand you your medal and blankets to warm you up. Then there\'s also locations where people can take pictures.\\n\\nHere\'s the picture I took with my family after leaving the half marathon area.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_19.jpeg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThe entire experience exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nWhile running isn\'t my favorite activity, completing a half marathon with my parents on the finish line was awesome.\\n\\nFinally, at home, I sent an e-mail to everyone who donated thanking them for the donation, letting them know how much was raised, and how the event went.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_20.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThis is something I borrowed from my friend [Nick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasbcarreras/) when I donated to his team relay race.\\n\\nLooking forward to doing a full marathon next!\\n\\n## Stats\\n\\nSome stats below for the curious,\\n\\n<div style={{ display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'center\', gap: \'10px\', flexWrap: \'wrap\' }}>\\n    <img width=\\"49%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_21.png\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"49%\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-18-my-first-half-marathon_22.png\\" />\\n</div>"},{"id":"the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation.md","title":"The $10 trillion OpenBB Copilot validation","description":"At the recent AI Engineering Summit, BlackRock unveiled their Aladdin Copilot - a platform remarkably similar to what we\'ve built at OpenBB, but with a key difference.

If you\'re working in the agentic space, this is arguably one of the best conferences available.\\n\\nOne presentation that particularly caught my attention was BlackRock\'s session about their Aladdin Copilot. While I can\'t share the presentation materials as they\'re conference-exclusive, what I saw left me incredibly bullish about OpenBB\'s direction.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation_1.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nHere\'s why: BlackRock\'s copilot is remarkably similar to what we\'ve built at OpenBB - but with 1% of their resources and one major distinction.\\n\\nLet\'s dive into the striking similarities first.\\n\\n## Not a single workflow, but multiple applications\\n\\nBlackRock\'s Aladdin platform centers heavily on Portfolio - enabling users to handle portfolio construction, management, and monitoring.\\n\\nIn contrast, OpenBB\'s Workspace functions as an open playground. While it certainly handles portfolio management (as demonstrated in [this example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K80ayaZYyk4)), it extends far beyond that. Our platform supports risk management, equity/crypto/macro research, ideation, ranking, client advisory, and even compliance workflows.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation_2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThis versatility stems from our workspace architecture where users build on their own data. The flexible widget creation system can accommodate virtually any workflow - provided users have the necessary data.\\n\\n## Not a single chatting interface, the agent is on the side and is invoked when needed\\n\\nThis is a hill I\'m willing to die on.\\n\\nFor the most part, analysts and PMs don\'t want a chat-only interface for their daily work. I wrote about this extensively [8 months ago](https://openbb.co/blog/why-chat-only-ai-financial-assistants-are-not-the-answer-you-might-think-they-are), and my conviction has only strengthened.\\n\\nBlackRock appears to share this view. Their agentic copilot acts as a sidebar to the main interface, allowing users to query dashboard data and quickly validate information without disrupting their workflow.\\n\\nSeeing this in their demo was genuinely shocking - it looked remarkably similar to what we\'ve had in OpenBB for over a year now. It\'s validating to see the world\'s largest asset manager (with 20k employees) arriving at the same conclusions we did.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation_3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## Explainability\\n\\nBoth platforms prioritize data transparency. Every copilot response that references dashboard data clearly highlights its source. This enables users to validate LLM outputs and trace information back to its origin, maintaining trust and accountability.\\n\\nAn example of how it can highlight sentence or table level in unstructured document:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation_4.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nAn example of how it can highlight the widget origin that was used to answer to the prompt:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation_5.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## Secure environment first approach\\n\\nThis is non-negotiable in finance, where both data and prompts can be competitive advantages. Our president, [Heidi Jonhson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidisjohnson/), recently detailed our approach to this in our [on-prem announcement](https://openbb.co/blog/run-openbb-on-premises-and-be-in-control-of-your-data-and-UI).\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nWhile I can\'t share specifics from BlackRock\'s presentation, I can explain OpenBB\'s architecture, which appears to follow identical principles.\\n\\nOur OpenBB Copilot acts as an orchestrator, gathering context from three main sources (in order of importance):\\n\\n1. **In-context**: Either attached files or explicitly referenced data widgets\\n2. **Dashboard**: Data currently visible in the dashboard\\n3. **Product-wide**: Connected to the workspace but not visible\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation_6.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThis context exists in the form of widgets, and there can be thousands! In the case of BlackRock, they refer to this as Plugin Registry.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation_7.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### What is a widget?\\n\\nIn our system, a widget combines:\\n\\n- Data origin (API endpoint, static file, SQL query with DB connection, etc)\\n- The parameters that can be modified to query a variation of the data\\n- Metadata (title, description, category, sub-category, and source)\\n\\nThe metadata enables our copilot to identify and utilize appropriate widget based on user prompts, by controlling the widget through its parameters.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation_8.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nYou can think of these widgets effectively as tools that are rendered on our workspace. Therefore, our agent can call different widgets to retrieve the data it needs to reply more effectively to the user.\\n\\nFor a deeper dive into this architecture, check out my recent [10-minute presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH1mMtRa84Y) or the blog [here](https://didierlopes.com/blog/2025-03-01-how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb).\\n\\n## Distinction\\n\\nSo what is the main distinction?\\n\\nHow Open we are.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"1200\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-11-the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation_9.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nWe have an open source data integration framework that enables any firm from bringing any type of data into our product.\\n\\nWe have an open source agentic framework that enables any firm to build their own agent (even one running locally).\\n\\nAnd we intend to open source much more.\\n\\nWe believe in a future where each firm will build their own tools on top of the most popular open source infra.\\n\\nIf you fall under that umbrella, reach out."},{"id":"proactive-agents-are-the-future-of-ai-in-finance","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/proactive-agents-are-the-future-of-ai-in-finance","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-03-07-proactive-agents-are-the-future-of-ai-in-finance.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-07-proactive-agents-are-the-future-of-ai-in-finance.md","title":"Proactive Agents Are the Future of AI in Finance","description":"How AI is evolving from reactive to proactive in financial services, and why this shift will transform how investors discover opportunities and generate alpha.","date":"2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"financial-services","permalink":"/blog/tags/financial-services"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"investment","permalink":"/blog/tags/investment"},{"inline":true,"label":"proactive-agents","permalink":"/blog/tags/proactive-agents"},{"inline":true,"label":"agents","permalink":"/blog/tags/agents"},{"inline":true,"label":"future","permalink":"/blog/tags/future"}],"readingTime":3.39,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"proactive-agents-are-the-future-of-ai-in-finance","title":"Proactive Agents Are the Future of AI in Finance","date":"2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-03-07-proactive-agents-are-the-future-of-ai-in-finance","tags":["openbb","financial-services","ai","investment","proactive-agents","agents","future"],"description":"How AI is evolving from reactive to proactive in financial services, and why this shift will transform how investors discover opportunities and generate alpha.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The $10 trillion OpenBB Copilot validation","permalink":"/blog/the-10-trillion-openbb-copilot-validation"},"nextItem":{"title":"My key takeaways from Institutional Investor conference","permalink":"/blog/my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-07-proactive-agents-are-the-future-of-ai-in-finance.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nHow AI is evolving from reactive to proactive in financial services, and why this shift will transform how investors discover opportunities and generate alpha.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nImagine waking up to find your AI assistant has already analyzed overnight market movements, identified three potential investment opportunities aligned with your strategy, and prepared a briefing on key economic indicators that might impact your portfolio today. This isn\'t science fiction\u2014it\'s the imminent future of AI in finance.\\n\\n## The Evolution of Financial AI: From Reactive to Proactive\\n\\nThis week I was asked the question \\"Where is OpenBB with AI next year?\\".\\n\\nOur play here is clear, we are the Enterprise UI that lives between data and AI.\\n\\nSo when someone asks this question, they are ultimately asking \\"What will be possible to do on OpenBB as models get better and cheaper\\".\\n\\nAnd I think that it all comes down to: **Reactive VS Proactive**\\n\\n### The Current State: Reactive AI\\n\\nToday, LLMs/agents/AI is reactive for the most part.\\n\\nIt requires users to have a clear intent on what they want the LLM to do, they are required to be prompted (pun intended). You ask a question, the AI answers. You request an analysis, the AI delivers. The interaction is fundamentally user-initiated and bounded by the specificity of your requests.\\n\\nThis reactive paradigm, while powerful, places the burden of discovery on the human user. You need to know what to ask for, when to ask for it, and how to frame your questions.\\n\\n### The Future State: Proactive AI\\n\\nHowever, what happens when models get better and cheaper and they have an interface that has access to all their data in one place?\\n\\nSimple.\\n\\nIt can scan the data every few seconds and generate investment ideas, find alpha and truly act like a partner. A proactive AI agent might:\\n\\n- Alert you to unusual trading patterns in a sector you\'re tracking\\n- Identify correlations between market events and your portfolio performance\\n- Suggest portfolio rebalancing based on changing market conditions\\n- Highlight emerging trends before they become mainstream investment theses\\n\\nMore importantly, as the agent starts to engage with the user, we will be able to provide feedback to the model: \\"this wasn\'t a good idea because of X\\", \\"semi-conductors are not part of my mandate\\", ... and these models will adapt to become more personalized.\\n\\n## Real-World Applications\\n\\nImagine a portfolio manager receiving an alert: \\"Three companies in your watchlist have shown unusual options activity following yesterday\'s Fed announcement. Based on your previous trading patterns, this may represent an opportunity in line with your contrarian strategy.\\"\\n\\nOr consider a risk analyst being notified: \\"We\'ve detected a 3.2 standard deviation move in correlation between your two largest positions. Here\'s an analysis of what might be driving this change and three potential hedging strategies.\\"\\n\\nThe exciting thing?\\n\\nWe aren\'t that far off from this being a reality.\\n\\n## The OpenBB Vision\\n\\nAt OpenBB, we\'re building the infrastructure to make this proactive AI future possible. By creating a unified interface between financial data and AI capabilities, we\'re enabling the next generation of intelligent financial assistants that don\'t just answer questions\u2014they anticipate needs.\\n\\nThis is how I envision the future:\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTvaks7EDh0?si=szd8RNFyMD_SPAHm\\"\\n        width=\\"1000\\"\\n        height=\\"500\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\n## What this means for you\\n\\nThe shift from reactive to proactive AI will fundamentally change how financial professionals work:\\n\\n1. **Time efficiency**: Less time spent on routine data gathering and more time on high-value decision making\\n2. **Expanded opportunity set**: Discover investment ideas outside your usual information channels\\n3. **Personalized intelligence**: AI that learns your preferences, risk tolerance, and investment style\\n4. **Competitive edge**: Early identification of market shifts and anomalies\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe future of finance isn\'t just about having better answers\u2014it\'s about having an AI partner that asks better questions."},{"id":"my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-03-05-my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-05-my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference.md","title":"My key takeaways from Institutional Investor conference","description":"Key insights from financial services technology leaders on AI adoption, including build vs. buy strategies, data privacy concerns, technology adoption divides, and the challenges of moving from prototypes to production-ready solutions.","date":"2025-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"financial-services","permalink":"/blog/tags/financial-services"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai-adoption","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai-adoption"},{"inline":true,"label":"data-privacy","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-privacy"},{"inline":true,"label":"enterprise-ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/enterprise-ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"build-vs-buy","permalink":"/blog/tags/build-vs-buy"},{"inline":true,"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"inline":true,"label":"finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/finance"},{"inline":true,"label":"local-deployment","permalink":"/blog/tags/local-deployment"}],"readingTime":4.33,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference","title":"My key takeaways from Institutional Investor conference","date":"2025-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-03-05-my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference.jpg","tags":["openbb","financial-services","ai-adoption","data-privacy","enterprise-ai","build-vs-buy","open-source","finance","local-deployment"],"description":"Key insights from financial services technology leaders on AI adoption, including build vs. buy strategies, data privacy concerns, technology adoption divides, and the challenges of moving from prototypes to production-ready solutions.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Proactive Agents Are the Future of AI in Finance","permalink":"/blog/proactive-agents-are-the-future-of-ai-in-finance"},"nextItem":{"title":"Building a custom widget for my friends newsletter","permalink":"/blog/building-a-custom-widget-for-my-friends-newsletter"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-05-my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference.jpg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nKey insights from financial services technology leaders on AI adoption, including build vs. buy strategies, data privacy concerns, technology adoption divides, and the challenges of moving from prototypes to production-ready solutions.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nI just returned from an insightful financial services technology conference where CTOs, CIOs, and technology leaders shared their perspectives on AI.\\n\\nI was on the stage on the topic of \\"Autonomous Agents \u2014 The Next Step in AI Applications?\\" which was one of my favorite panels that I\'ve ever done.\\n\\nThis allowed me to have extremely insigthful conversations with industry leaders managing dozens to hundreds of billions of dollars in AUM.\\n\\nHere are the most valuable insights I gathered:\\n\\n## The build vs. buy evolution\\n\\nFinancial institutions increasingly prefer building over buying complete solutions. Most follow a hybrid approach\u2014purchasing foundational technology but building customized layers on top. The consensus is that this approach reduces complexity in the long term while avoiding vendor lock-in.\\n\\n> **OpenBB hat on**: This is one of the reasons we love open source - it gives users a third option: building on top of an infrastructure that is continuously maintained and improved, allowing firms to focus solely on their workflows.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n\\n## AI adoption challenges\\n\\nDespite the hype, financial services firms struggle with AI implementation, primarily due to unclear use cases. There is no dominant AI product in the industry, and most organizations cautiously use general tools under strict controls.\\n\\n> **OpenBB hat on**: This is a great sign that we are still early, and there isn\'t yet a clear winner in AI financial products. It also indicates that companies need to invest capital in educating the market\u2014not just about their products (I\'m guilty of this) but about the workflows that AI can enable. (Luckily, [Ihsan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ihsan-erman-saracgil-42628454/) joined the team recently, and I\'ve seen him build full workflows for clients like this [earnings workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTlyU6HdWjQ) solely on OpenBB. If you\'re looking for something specific, he\'s the person to ask!)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-05-my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference_1.jpg\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## Data privacy concerns without local solutions\\n\\nSignificant concern was expressed about data leakage when using AI tools, with strict policies such as \\"no credit card swipes for AI tools\\" and \\"turn off uploads\\" being common. Interestingly, no one mentioned running open-weight models locally, a solution that would address these privacy concerns by keeping data in-house. This represents a major market education opportunity, as firms are worried about data leaving their environment but aren\'t aware of alternatives to cloud-based AI services.\\n\\n> **OpenBB hat on**: This one really surprised me. It may be because most products currently follow a traditional SaaS model. However, I saw a clear need for on-prem/VPC deployments where firms run open-weight models locally with zero data leakage. We can do this \u2014 and we might be one of the few products on the market that can today.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n## Technology adoption divide\\n\\nA clear divide exists between technology resistors and embracers. Some professionals cling to legacy tools and manual processes, seemingly to preserve their relevance. Meanwhile, AI adopters are achieving remarkable productivity gains, quickly building React applications, simulations, and analytical tools.\\n\\n> **OpenBB hat on**:  This trend was expected. I\'ve personally experienced how AI has dramatically increased my coding efficiency. As the cost of building continues to approach zero, we\'ll see exponential opportunities to automate workflows. Talent with AI expertise won\'t just deliver 2-3x value for their firms but potentially 10x or more. This represents both a challenge and an opportunity for organizations ready to embrace these new capabilities.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n## Prototype-to-production gap\\n\\nA common challenge is bridging the gap between 70% done prototypes and enterprise-ready solutions. AI enables rapid development and impressive demos, but the real challenge is implementing governance, security, compliance, and scalability for production environments. Organizations need talent that can leverage AI for rapid innovation while also understanding enterprise requirements to bring projects to completion.\\n\\n> **OpenBB hat on**: This reality is particularly evident in development practices. A quick demo in Streamlit can be built in minutes\u2014great for rapid prototyping. However, such solutions rarely meet enterprise standards. Developing production-ready features like RBAC, SSO, administrative controls, sharing capabilities, comprehensive logging, and reporting systems requires an entirely different skill set and approach. We often see firms approaching us after realizing their prototype tools won\'t scale to meet their long-term strategic objectives.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n## What this means for OpenBB\\n\\nOpenBB is uniquely positioned at the intersection of these trends. As an open workspace that supports bring-your-own-data, local AI deployment, and enterprise-grade features, we provide financial institutions with the flexibility to build custom solutions while addressing security concerns and bridging the prototype-to-production gap.\\n\\nOur approach aligns perfectly with the industry\'s evolving needs, making us an ideal partner for forward-thinking financial organizations navigating AI transformation.\\n\\nIf you want to chat, feel free to e-mail me at didier.lopes[at]openbb.finance."},{"id":"building-a-custom-widget-for-my-friends-newsletter","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/building-a-custom-widget-for-my-friends-newsletter","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-03-03-building-a-custom-widget-for-my-friends-newsletter.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-03-building-a-custom-widget-for-my-friends-newsletter.md","title":"Building a custom widget for my friends newsletter","description":"How I built a custom OpenBB widget to save my friend hours of manual work on his newsletter with 190,000+ subscribers.","date":"2025-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"widget","permalink":"/blog/tags/widget"},{"inline":true,"label":"automation","permalink":"/blog/tags/automation"},{"inline":true,"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"inline":true,"label":"fintech","permalink":"/blog/tags/fintech"},{"inline":true,"label":"api","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"},{"inline":true,"label":"side-project","permalink":"/blog/tags/side-project"},{"inline":true,"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/blog/tags/newsletter"}],"readingTime":1.79,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"building-a-custom-widget-for-my-friends-newsletter","title":"Building a custom widget for my friends newsletter","date":"2025-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2025-03-03-building-a-custom-widget-for-my-friends-newsletter","tags":["openbb","widget","automation","open-source","fintech","api","side-project","newsletter"],"description":"How I built a custom OpenBB widget to save my friend hours of manual work on his newsletter with 190,000+ subscribers.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"My key takeaways from Institutional Investor conference","permalink":"/blog/my-key-takeaways-from-institutional-investor-conference"},"nextItem":{"title":"How function calling and context-aware AI shapes OpenBB","permalink":"/blog/how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-03-building-a-custom-widget-for-my-friends-newsletter.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nHow I built a custom OpenBB widget to save my friend hours of manual work on his newsletter with 190,000+ subscribers.\\n\\nThe open source code is available [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/opening-bell-daily-openbb).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nLast weekend I spoke with my friend <a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/philrosen/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Phil Rosen</a>.\\n\\nHe used to work as a Senior Markets Reporter at Business Insider.\\n\\nAnd left to start his own news and research outlet: <a href=\\"https://www.openingbelldailynews.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Opening Bell Daily</a>, just over 1 year ago.\\n\\nHe\'s been sharing a newsletter everyday since and has crossed over 190,000 subscribers!!!\\n\\nFunnily enough, we commented on how we were speaking on a Saturday morning and the weekends are the times where we are the most productive.\\n\\nAs I was sharing more of OpenBB and how he can utilize it for the content in his newsletter, he shared a table chart that he crafts manually to his audience, which always takes him a significant amount of time to do every single day.\\n\\nWell, I wouldn\'t be an engineer by training if I didn\'t solve this for him.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hQtFL_0NjU?si=oUC-X0XsnKad-V9E\\"\\n        width=\\"1000\\"\\n        height=\\"500\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\nMore than that -

Anote AI Day Summit 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH1mMtRa84Y).\\n\\nThis blog post is a similar presentation in text-written format.\\n\\n## Our vision for the OpenBB Workspace\\n\\nAt the core of our product is the OpenBB workspace, a fully customizable dashboard where users can control their data visualization and analysis. The middle section shows a dashboard that you can fully customize with widgets containing relevant data widgets. We\'ve designed it with a practical sidebar for managing dashboards, folder organization, sharing capabilities, templates, and data connections.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-01-how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb_1.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nBut what I\'m going to talk about is our agentic sidebar on the right. This is effectively your AI agent that works as an analyst with access to all the data inside the product. And this is where our implementation of function calling becomes crucial.\\n\\n## Context is key\\n\\nWe\'ve developed three ways to provide context to our Copilot:\\n\\n1. **Explicit context**: We\'ve added a simple button on the top right of widgets that allows users to directly add them to the Copilot\'s context.

This allows us to scale effectively while maintaining accuracy, especially since there can be literally thousands of data widgets. Due to the metadata, widgets are only invoked when a user triggers a relevant prompt.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-01-how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb_8.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n## Function Calling in practice\\n\\nLet me share some real examples of how this works.\\n\\n### Basic function calls\\n\\nWhen analyzing unstructured data like market reports, our Copilot can extract specific information without parameter changes:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-01-how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb_9.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nCopilot understands from widget metadata that the user requires information from it and queries it:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-01-how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb_10.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nIn turn that data is utilized to answer the prompt:\\n\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-01-how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb_11.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Parameter-modified calls\\n\\nWe can handle cases where users want to switch contexts.\\n\\nFor instance, even if you\'re looking at Apple news, you can ask about Palantir, and our system will automatically adjust the parameters:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-01-how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb_12.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nCopilot understands from widget metadata that the user requires information from it and queries it:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-03-01-how-function-calling-and-context-aware-ai-shapes-openbb_13.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nBut, not as is.

The market has seen heavy investment in solving the data layer, but little attention has been paid to the UI layer\u2014the critical bridge between raw data and actionable intelligence.\\n\\n**Why?**\\n\\nBecause building intuitive financial UIs requires a rare combination of deep market knowledge and modern technical expertise.\\n\\nMost financial professionals excel at understanding markets but aren\'t software engineers, while most software engineers don\'t have extensive financial domain experience.\\n\\nThis expertise gap has led to a reliance on familiar but limited tools like Excel, or third party desktop apps.\\n\\nBut the shift is happening.

They had to handle multiple documents with over 200-300 pages each with text, tables and images. Their current process of doing this with RAG wasn\'t leading to the best results and it was very time consuming when analyzing the results. But also there wasn\'t a systematic approach being taken to improve the prompt for data retrieval (e.g. few-shot prompt).\\n\\nGiven that I had been reading about people saying that \\"RAG is dead\\" because of Gemini models havign 1M+ input context, I wanted to test this model myself. At the same time I wanted to help my friend in setting up a pipeline that would help them automating their data retrieval pipeline.\\n\\nThis post is going to focus on the approach I took, why and how you can set it up yourself.\\n\\nNote: This isn\'t meant to be a production ready pipeline, but enable you to \\"vibe test\\" your ingestion pipeline + data retrieval model + prompts. Funnily enough, this was mostly built in a day through _vibe coding_ (Karpathy\'s coined the term recently).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-02-18-long-live-long-context-with-gemini_1.png\\" />\\n    <p align=\\"center\\" className=\\"mt-1\\" style={{fontSize: \\"0.75em\\"}}>\\n        <a href=\\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Karpathy tweet</a>\\n    </p>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Starting point\\n\\nThis is what my friend sent me:\\n\\n- Complex PDFs with 200 pages comprised of text, images and tables\\n- An Excel spreadsheet with rows corresponding to values that were being attempted to retrieve and columns including prompt, value returned and correct value.\\n\\nThe Excel spreadsheet effectively served as eval, which enabled them to understand whether a better model/pipeline would lead to better results or not. However, this process was very manual.\\n\\nThe equivalent here is the following:\\n\\n- I will be using the following documents: [DeepSeek_R1 paper](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/long-live-long-context/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf) and [Capital Market Outlook report](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/long-live-long-context/blob/main/ME-cio-weekly-letter.pdf). I just had these two at hand to serve as an example.\\n\\n- I won\'t be using an Excel spreadsheet, but instead will rely on files in a directory called `data` within the project.\\n\\nHere are the prompts that I\'m going to test:\\n\\n| idx | ID | Prompt | Expected Result |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 0 | Consumer Discretionary vs Consumer Staples comparison cap-weighted | By how much did Consumer Discretionary outperform Consumer Staples over the last three months on cap-weighted? | +17% |\\n| 1 | Consumer Discretionary vs Consumer Staples comparison equal-weighted | By how much did Consumer Discretionary outperform Consumer Staples over the last three months on equal-weighted? | +13% |\\n| 2 | Fed funds rate Q4 2024E | What is the Fed funds rate, end period (%) for Q4 2024E? | 4.38 |\\n| 3 | DeepSeek-R1-Zero GPQA Diamond pass@1 | What was DeepSeek-R1-Zero GPQA Diamond pass@1 benchmark? | 73.3 |\\n| 4 | DeepSeek V3 C-SimpleQA | What was DeepSeek V3 C-SimpleQA bemchmark? | 68.0% |\\n| 5 | Number of reasoning related training samples | How many reasoning related training samples were collected? | 600k |\\n\\nNote: Prompts 0-2 can be found in Capital Market Outlook report whilst prompts 3-5 in DeepSeek R1 paper.\\n\\n## Setting up this experiment\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\nCreate a folder called data with the following structure: \\n\\n```bash\\ndata/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 system_prompt.txt\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 0/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 id.txt\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 prompt.txt\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 expected.txt\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 1/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 id.txt\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 prompt.txt\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 expected.txt\\n```\\n\\nSee our example [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/long-live-long-context/tree/main/data).\\n\\nLet\'s go through each of these:\\n\\n### System prompt\\n\\nContains the system prompt to be used throughout entire application in a `system_prompt.txt` file.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"1200\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-02-18-long-live-long-context-with-gemini_2.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Prompt\\n\\nEach prompt will have a folder with the idx in the order of it being run - e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...\\n\\nInside this folder you will find 3 files: `id.txt`, `prompt.txt` and `expected.txt`. Note that this follows the table that we displayed above.\\n\\n#### ID\\n\\nContains an identifier that we can use to understand what prompt that is.

System Prompt\\n\\nThis is the system prompt that will be used across all prompts utilized to retrieve data from context.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"1200\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-02-18-long-live-long-context-with-gemini_7.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nThe EDIT button allows user to modify the content that lives in [`data/system_prompt.txt`](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/long-live-long-context/blob/main/data/system_prompt.txt) and override it.\\n\\n### 3. Load documents\\n\\nThis allows the user to pick any document that are next to the `app.py` file on the root of the project. You can select multiple documents and their content will be appended together.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"1200\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-02-18-long-live-long-context-with-gemini_8.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nWhen a document is loaded, you will be able to understand how many tokens each document utilizes when being pushed into Gemini 2.0 flash - through `model.count_tokens()`. In addition, you will understand how many tokens are being utilized with the combination of all documents uploaded.\\n\\n### 4. Run prompts\\n\\nThis one is slightly more complex, let\'s take it each section at a time.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"1200\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-02-18-long-live-long-context-with-gemini_9.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n#### Run all prompts\\n\\nBy clicking on \\"\u25b6\ufe0f\u25b6\ufe0f\u25b6\ufe0f Run all prompts\\", all prompts get run utilizing Gemini 2.0 Flash with the context provided, in the following format:\\n\\n<CodeBlock language=\\"python\\">\\n{`response = model.generate_content(\\n    f\\"\\"\\"\\n    {system_prompt}\\n    ---\\n    {st.session_state.document_content}\\n    ---\\n    {prompt}\\n    \\"\\"\\",\\n    generation_config={\\"temperature\\": 0},\\n)\\n`}\\n</CodeBlock>\\n\\nThe \\"Free Gemini tier (adds timer if running all prompts)\\" toggle is meant for users that aren\'t paying for Google API and adds a 60s delay after running each prompt. Note: Upgrading to a paid API key is recommended if you are dealing with sensitive data, so that your data is not used by Google for training.\\n\\nRemember: \\"If something is free, you are the product\\" \ud83d\ude42.\\n\\nNow you may be wondering:\\n\\n> _\\"Why is there a green \'\u2705 Response matches expected result\' box. How does the model know that the answer is accurate?\\"_.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThat is because after running the prompt, I take the output and use Gemini 2.0 Flash to compare it against the compared answer. Basically doing LLM as a judge so I have a quick sense of how many prompts I got correct and which ones I didn\'t and work on the failed ones.\\n\\nThis is the prompt that happens under the hood:\\n\\n<CodeBlock language=\\"python\\">\\n{`comparison_response = model.generate_content(\\n    f\\"\\"\\"\\n    Compare these two texts and return only \'True\' if they convey the same meaning,\\n    or \'False\' if they differ in meaning.\\n    Don\'t worry about units as long as the numerical value are the same.\\n\\n    Do not add anything else. Just one word: \'True\' or \'False\'.\\n    \\n    Expected:\\n    {expected}\\n    \\n    Actual:\\n    {response.text}\\n\\n    The meaning of the expected response and the actual response is the same. This statement is: \\n    \\"\\"\\",\\n    generation_config={\\n        \\"temperature\\": 0,\\n        \\"candidate_count\\": 1\\n    },\\n)\\n`}\\n</CodeBlock>\\n\\n#### Individual prompts\\n\\nThe concept of running an individual prompt is very similar to the run all prompts, with the exception that it takes approximately \\"Run all prompts time\\"/\\"Number of all prompts\\" for each. So it\'s better to iterate on a single prompt and the quality of its data retrieval.\\n\\nIn addition, it has a few additional features that can be helpful to iterate:\\n\\n- You can click on \\"EDIT\\" to edit the `prompt.txt` directly from the interface. This enables to tweak the prompt to be better at retrieving that specific information (e.g. few shot prompt, which is something that my friend wasn\'t doing and was contributing to lower accuracy).\\n- You can click on \\"EDIT\\" to edit the `expected.txt` directly from the interface. This was particularly relevant when I saw that the LLM as a judge failed when the model retrieved 68.0% for a particular prompt and the expected string I had was 68.0. In this case, the model was actually accurate and my expected value should have been either 68.0% or 0.68.\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\n### Data ingestion\\n\\nThis is one of the most important parts of the workflow:\\n\\n<CodeBlock language=\\"python\\">\\n{`# Convert PDF to images\\nimages = convert_from_path(tmp_path, dpi=300)  # can be increased for higher accuracy\\n\\n# Open PDF with fitz\\npdf_document = fitz.open(tmp_path)\\n\\nfile_content = \\"\\"\\n\\n# Process each page\\nfor page_number in range(len(pdf_document)):\\n    page = pdf_document.load_page(page_number)\\n    if page.get_drawings():  # OCR needed for vector content\\n        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(\\n            images[page_number], lang=\\"eng\\"\\n        )\\n    else:  # Extract text directly\\n        text = page.get_text(\\"text\\")\\n    file_content += text + \\"\\\\\\\\n\\"\\n\\npdf_document.close()\\n`}\\n</CodeBlock>\\n\\nFrom my friend results, I saw that it was consistently failing for a few prompts. The main reason for that was because the data was in a table that was an image underneat and the PDF reader didn\'t parse images. That meant that it didn\'t matter how good the prompt was, the model was set up for failure.\\n\\nI don\'t think the pipeline I\'ve built is particularly strong but it highlights an example of how one can handle a scenario with text, tables and images going through each page individually by:\\n\\n- Check if there is an image\\n    - If there is, do OCR using Tesseract to extract text\\n    - If there isn\'t, use PyMuPDF to extract text\\n\\nI believe that something that would improve results immediately is running the output of the OCR by a LLM and trying to reconstruct the table/image in markdown format if possible. I say this because I noticed that sometimes the OCR output can be a bit messy, and having an LLM focused on adding structure to each page OCR may lead to better outcomes.\\n\\n\\n### Long context is a blessing\\n\\nSomething I noticed from the data my friend shared is that the RAG pipeline they had implemented struggled when the value that the model had to return wasn\'t immediate but it had to pick values from different places to piece it together.\\n\\nImagine you were asking the model about the number of reasoning related training samples and the PDF mentioned that the number of reasoning related training samples was 2% of the training dataset samples. And in another page it said that the training dataset has 30 million samples. You need to get both of these in order to infer that the number of reasoning related training samples is 600k samples.\\n\\n### Subject matter experts are more relevant than ever\\n\\nDespite advances in LLM capabilities, domain expertise remains crucial for effective prompt engineering. During testing, many retrieval failures stemmed not from model limitations, but from prompts that didn\'t properly account for domain-specific context and terminology.\\n\\nAs a non-expert, I found it challenging to craft effective prompts because I lacked deep understanding of:\\n\\n- How specific data points are typically represented in this type of document\\n- The precise meaning and significance of domain terminology\\n- Common document structures and conventions in the field\\n- How small variations in wording could make it so that the metric extracted wasn\'t the correct one\\n\\n### Set a benchmark and work reverse from there\\n\\nBefore starting this work I had a benchmark where I was working backwards from. This was super helpful as it allows me to understand how this workflow, out-of-the-box, compares with my friends\' one.\\n\\nThen we can work backwards from there and:\\n\\n- Improve the system prompt\\n- Use a different model (and get rid of RAG eheh)\\n- Improve ingestion pipeline to process images\\n- Automate process a bit better with a Streamlit app\\n- Improve each individual prompt to retrieve information more accurately (few-shot prompt)\\n\\n### Prompt testing and validation\\n\\nUsing LLMs as judges and being able to run prompts from the app, enabled to have a much more seamless workflow. This approach:\\n\\n- Provides immediate feedback on prompt effectiveness\\n- Helps iterate and refine prompting strategies\\n- Ensures consistency in information extraction\\n- Reduces the need for manual verification\\n\\n## Long live Long Context\\n\\nHonestly, long context is f*ing awesome.\\n\\nHere are a few things that made me really happy:\\n\\n- Ability to handle multiple documents at once without having to worry about chunking or managing context windows\\n- No need to worry about losing context between different sections of a document\\n- Reduced complexity in the overall pipeline since we don\'t need complex RAG infrastructure\\n- Better accuracy (in theory) since the model has access to the full context and can make connections across different parts of the document\\n- Faster development time since we don\'t need to spend time optimizing chunking strategies or fine-tuning retrieval mechanisms\\n\\n## Next\\n\\nI won\'t be spending more time on this project, as I did it to help a friend on their specific problem. I wrote this post so that I could share this with them and any other person in the future that is getting into LLMs.\\n\\nFeel free to fork the project and go wild."},{"id":"what-it-means-to-have-skin-in-the-game","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/what-it-means-to-have-skin-in-the-game","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-01-30-what-it-means-to-have-skin-in-the-game.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-30-what-it-means-to-have-skin-in-the-game.md","title":"What it means to have skin in the game","description":"From getting the OpenBB logo tattooed to honoring a promise of a Bali trip, this is a personal reflection on what it truly means to have \\"skin in the game\\".

(PS: you can find more books that I\'ve read over the years <a href=\\"/books/already-read\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">here</a>).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-01-30-what-it-means-to-have-skin-in-the-game_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThe idea of having real stakes in your decisions isn\'t new to me \u2013 it\'s something I\'ve lived by for as long as I can remember. Taleb\'s writing puts it into words beautifully, but for me, this has always been a way of life.\\n\\nI believe in going all-in on what matters. In fact, I\'m so committed to this philosophy that I have OpenBB logo tattooed on my body.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-01-30-what-it-means-to-have-skin-in-the-game.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nIt\'s not about showing off or trying to prove something. It\'s a reminder that when I\'m in, I\'m all the way in. No half measures, no excuses. This isn\'t about taking wild risks for the sake of it \u2013 it\'s about standing behind what you believe in, fully and without hesitation.\\n\\nThis mindset started when I was young, mostly from my dad.\\n\\nI learned that our word has to mean something. Promises weren\'t just things I would say, they were real commitments that I always followed through.\\n\\nI remember when we were kids I told one of my friends jokingly \\"if you do x, I will give you 2 euros\\" and he did it and we laughed. The day after I brought him 2 euros to school and he had forgotten about it.\\n\\nMore recently, I promised my friends that if the open source project I had started (Gamestonk Terminal) ever became a company, I\'d cover a two-week stay accommodation in Bali. When <a href=\\"https://openbb.co/blog/gme-didnt-take-me-to-the-moon-but-gamestonk-terminal-did\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">OpenBB raised money</a>, I let them know and we booked that trip for the following year.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-01-30-what-it-means-to-have-skin-in-the-game_2.JPG\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThat wasn\'t just talk. It was a real promise, tied to real accountability.\\n\\nThe way I see it, taking risks and owning the results \u2013 good or bad \u2013 is what separates people who truly stand for something from those who just talk about it. When you\'re all in, you can\'t hide. If things go wrong, you take the hit. If they go right, you\'ve earned it. Either way, you\'re accountable.\\n\\nThis idea of skin in the game just makes so much sense to me, why wouldn\'t you?\\n\\nIt\'s about showing up fully in everything you do, whether it\'s work, relationships, or personal goals. And it\'s about being honest with yourself and others when things don\'t go as planned.\\n\\nTrust is built by following through, especially when it\'s hard. When people know you\'ll keep your word, even when it\'s inconvenient, you build something way more valuable than a quick win: you build real trust. And that trust isn\'t just given; it\'s earned through consistency and integrity.\\n\\nThese days, it feels like too many people are afraid to commit. They hedge their bets, avoid risks, and try to keep their options open. But I\'ve found that being all-in \u2013 really having skin in the game \u2013 is the best way to live life.\\n\\nYou can also see this by the fact that I am pretty much an open book - either sharing what I\'m thinking through blogs like this or sharing all my code on GitHub.\\n\\nFor the better, or the worst."},{"id":"building-a-developer-friendly-interface-for-financial-analysts","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/building-a-developer-friendly-interface-for-financial-analysts","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-01-24-building-a-developer-friendly-interface-for-financial-analysts.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-24-building-a-developer-friendly-interface-for-financial-analysts.md","title":"Building a developer friendly interface for financial analysts","description":"In the financial software industry, there\'s a well-worn playbook - build proprietary software, deploy large sales teams, and leverage executive relationships.

An example of this are my <a href=\\"https://x.com/didier_lopes\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">posts on X</a>.\\n\\nThere are multiple libraries out there to scrape data from X. One that I used recently, and liked (without requiring an X API key) was <a href=\\"https://github.com/elizaOS/twitter-scraper-finetune\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Twitter scraper finetune from ElizaOS</a>.\\n\\n- **System 2**: Slower, more deliberative and more logic. An example of this is my blog, where some of these posts take me several hours to write and need to sleep on the topic before pushing.\\n\\nFor this, I didn\'t find any good out-of-the-box library that allowed me to convert my posts into a QA dataset to fine-tune a model.\\n\\nSo this is what I ended up building.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nIn order to do this you will need:\\n\\n- Python 3.11\\n- Poetry (for python dependencies)\\n- Ollama (to run Llama 3.2)\\n- Hugging Face account (for dataset upload)\\n\\nand obviously your blog in a JSON feed like <a href=\\"https://didierlopes.com/blog/feed.json\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">https://didierlopes.com/blog/feed.json</a>.\\n\\n#### 1.

While closed source has dominated many sectors due to massive capital investments by tech giants, we\'re approaching an inflection point where open source\'s victory seems not just possible, but unavoidable.\\n\\nThe traditional moat of proprietary software companies \u2013 their secret sauce of complex codebases built over years with massive engineering teams \u2013 is rapidly eroding.\\n\\nAI tools are democratizing software development to an unprecedented degree (I recently wrote a small post about this <a href=\\"https://didierlopes.com/blog/the-cost-of-building-software-is-plummeting-to-zero/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">here</a>). A small team can now accomplish what previously required hundreds of engineers, dramatically reducing the cost and complexity of building sophisticated software systems.\\n\\nWhat\'s particularly interesting is how AI itself has been trained on vast repositories of open-source code. This creates a virtuous cycle: more open-source code leads to better AI models, which in turn simplifies contributions and enhances collaborative projects. The barriers to entry for meaningful code contributions have never been lower.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-01-16-theres-a-zero-percent-chance-that-open-source-doesnt-win.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## The economic equation is shifting\\n\\nHistorically, companies might have chosen closed-source solutions because the cost of customizing open-source alternatives was prohibitively high. You needed specialized engineers who understood the codebase intimately, and modifications often required significant time and resources. This equation is evolving swiftly.\\nModern AI tools can:\\n\\n- Analyze and explain complex codebases in seconds\\n- Suggest modifications and optimizations\\n- Generate custom implementations based on specific requirements\\n- Debug and troubleshoot issues perfectly\\n\\nThis means companies can now take battle-tested open-source solutions and adapt them to their specific needs at a fraction of the traditional cost. The economic advantage of closed-source solutions is diminishing daily.\\n\\n## The network effect accelerates\\n\\nWhat makes this transformation particularly powerful is its self-reinforcing nature. Every company that chooses open source over proprietary solutions adds to the collective knowledge base. Each contribution, no matter how small, becomes part of the foundation that AI models learn from, making the next implementation easier and more robust.\\n\\nAs AI tools get better at understanding and manipulating code, the advantages of open source multiply:\\n\\n- Faster innovation cycles\\n- More diverse contributions from global developers\\n- Better security through transparent code review\\n- Reduced dependency on single vendors\\n- Lower total cost of ownership\\n\\n## The path forward\\n\\nWe\'re entering an era where the question isn\'t whether open source will win, but how long until it does.\\n\\nCompanies that embrace this reality early will have a significant advantage. They\'ll benefit from:\\n\\n- Reduced development costs\\n\\t- Larger pool of talent\\n\\t- Benefit from AI models being trained on this data\\n- Greater flexibility in customization\\n- Enhanced ability to attract talent who prefer working with open technologies\\n- Future-proofed technology stacks that can evolve with community innovations\\n\\nThe momentum behind open source is becoming inescapable. As AI continues to lower the barriers to entry and make code more accessible, the advantages of closed-source systems will continue to erode. The future is open, and it\'s approaching faster than many realize.\\n\\nI mean, I can now literally run a 7b Mistral AI model on my machine, fine-tune it, and run it locally. From a technological perspective, this is the best time there ever was to build software.\\n\\nIf you agree with this statement, why are you not building accordingly?"},{"id":"the-cost-of-building-software-is-plummeting-to-zero","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-cost-of-building-software-is-plummeting-to-zero","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2025-01-09-cost-of-ai-going-to-zero.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-09-cost-of-ai-going-to-zero.md","title":"The cost of building software is plummeting to zero","description":"AI is revolutionizing software development costs and shifting value creation in the financial industry.

Sometimes I just don\'t have the bandwidth, but it\'s much easier to fall into that if you are not constantly reminding yourself that you haven\'t coded since x days ago.\\n\\nSo, in order to keep myself accountable I bought a DeskHub which sits on my desk and I use to keep track of when I am shipping.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-01-07-tracking-my-writing-progress-through-an-open-source-blog-tracker-generator_1.jpeg\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nI am less interested in the quality and quantity, but that every day I open Cursor and do one of the following:\\n\\n- Fix a small bug or improve UI/UX on OpenBB (usually during the day)\\n- Add a new feature (usually during evening as more time is required)\\n- Write a new post on my website, like this one (evenings or weekend)\\n- Do a side project (weekend or holidays)\\n\\nWhile this has been working for a while, I realized that - for me - writing is as important as coding.\\n\\nIt not only helps me communicate better as a leader, but also (and more importantly) think more clearly.\\n\\nBut I didn\'t have a way to track that I have been practicing writing and putting myself out there.\\n\\nSo, I built one.\\n\\nI built a program that generates an SVG visualization of your blog post history - as long as you get your blog post history in ATOM XML or JSON feed.\\n\\nAnd open source it <a href=\\"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/blog-history-generator\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">here</a>.\\n\\n## Blog format\\n\\n<CodeBlock\\n    language=\\"javascript\\"\\n    title=\\"Common interface that all formats must conform to\\"\\n    showLineNumbers\\n>\\n{`interface Post {\\n  id: string;\\n  title: string;\\n  url: string;\\n  content_html: string;     // Falls back to \'content\' in some formats\\n  summary: string;           // Falls back to \'excerpt\' in some formats\\n  date_modified: string;  // Falls back to date_published/date/updated/published\\n  tags: string[];                // Defaults to [] if missing\\n}`}\\n</CodeBlock>\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n<Tabs>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"json\\" label=\\"JSON\\" default>\\n\\nExample: <a href=\\"https://didierlopes.com/blog/feed.json\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">https://didierlopes.com/blog/feed.json</a>\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-01-07-tracking-my-writing-progress-through-an-open-source-blog-tracker-generator_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"atom\\" label=\\"ATOM XML\\">\\n\\nExample: <a href=\\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette.atom\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette.atom</a>\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-01-07-tracking-my-writing-progress-through-an-open-source-blog-tracker-generator_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n  </TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n## Quick Setup\\n\\n1.

This exploration is particularly important for me, as we frequently discuss with prospects the possibility of integrating local AI agents into OpenBB to avoid reliance on third-party vendors.\\n\\nTo make this experiment practical and engaging, I needed a well-defined use case. My objective was straightforward: to develop an agent capable of focusing on a specific topic, gathering external information, and crafting a post to share on Bluesky triggered by myself.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-01-04-building-an-ai-agent-from-scratch-that-can-post-on-bluesky_1.jpg\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis is the workflow we are looking at:\\n\\n1. I send a message to my Telegram bot with the idea of what I want to post on Bluesky.\\n2. That message gets processed by my fine-tune agent, which runs locally.\\n3. That message is used to extract further context either from:\\n\\t1. OpenBB if financial information is needed.\\n\\t2. xAI if latest news from social media is needed.\\n\\t3. Perplexity if more information from the web is necessary.\\n4. The agent then writes a thought on the topic.\\n5. Then it pushes that post to Bluesky.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n### Environment Setup\\n\\nYou have a Bluesky account - like mine here: \xa0[https://bsky.app/profile/didierlopes.com](https://bsky.app/profile/didierlopes.com).\\n\\n- You will need `BLUESKY_HANDLE` and `BLUESKY_PASSWORD`.\\n\\nYou have a Telegram account and you have created a bot by following the steps highlighted here: \xa0[https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token](https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token).\\n\\n- You will need `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.\\n\\nYou have installed Ollama and are running a model like `Llama3.2:latest` locally.\\n\\nAdditionally, you will need the following tokens for the agent\'s tools:\\n- `OPENBB_PAT` which you can retrieve from: https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/pat\\n- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` which you can retrieve from: https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api\\n- `GROK_API_KEY` which you can retrieve from: https://console.x.ai/\\n\\n### Main libraries\\n\\nThe bot is built using several key libraries:\\n- **ATProto Client**: For interacting with the Bluesky social network\\n- **Python-Telegram-Bot**: For handling Telegram interactions\\n- **Asyncio**: For handling asynchronous operations\\n- **OpenBB**: To access financial data\\n- **OpenAI**: to hit Perplexity and Grok OpenAI compatible endpoints\\n\\n## Implementation\\n\\nFor this tutorial, I\'m not going to write about fine-tuning my own LLM to keep it simpler. I will leave that for another post where I want to share more on what I learned about doing so.\\n\\nI\'m also going through the step-by-step I performed in order to complete this project, so that this can serve as an inspiration for somebody starting something.\\n\\nI have a folder called \\"experiments\\" [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/telegram-text-to-bluesky-post/tree/main/experiments) which I use to show you how I experiment each subsystem independently and only after each individually works I merge them together. Dividing and conquering here is fundamental.\\n\\n### 1. Bluesky API\\n\\nI can\'t push a post to Bluesky if the API doesn\'t allow me to do so. Therefore, this is where I started.\\n\\n<CodeBlock\\n    language=\\"python\\"\\n    title={\\n        <a \\n            href=\\"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/telegram-text-to-bluesky-post/blob/main/experiments/bluesky-api.ipynb\\"\\n            target=\\"_blank\\"\\n            rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"\\n            style={{ fontWeight: \'bold\', color: \'#0366d6\' }}\\n        >\\n            /experiments/bluesky-api.ipynb\\n        </a>\\n    }\\n    showLineNumbers>\\n    {`from atproto import Client, client_utils\\nimport os\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\n\\nload_dotenv()\\n\\nclient = Client()\\nprofile = client.login(\\n    os.getenv(\'BLUESKY_HANDLE\'),\\n    os.getenv(\'BLUESKY_PASSWORD\')\\n)\\nprint(\'Welcome,\', profile.display_name)\\n\\ntext = client_utils.TextBuilder().text(\'Merry Christmas!\')\\npost = client.send_post(text)\\nclient.like(post.uri, post.cid)\\n`}\\n</CodeBlock>\\n\\nThe code is extremely simple, this made me understand how easy Bluesky API is to interact with.\\n\\nThe only thing I added to this was to create a thread of posts if the 300 character post limit was crossed. I didn\'t know the limit was 300 characters, and so had to handle that situation after when merging all the pieces together since, it turns out, AI agents like to write long posts (or my prompt didn\'t hint at not doing so strong enough).\\n\\n### 2. Telegram API\\n\\nIn order to push a post to Bluesky, I need to have something that triggers it.\\n\\nI could have automated this process as in \\"at 9am every day post something on a topic\\", but I wanted the subject to vary and retain control over what my agent does research on.\\n\\nTherefore, I chose Telegram to act as the \\"trigger\\". I have used Discord and Slack in the past, this allowed me to get familiar with interacting with a bot on Telegram.\\n\\nI was actually mind-blown by how simple they made the process. More on this here: https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token.\\n\\nThen I tested that I could send a Telegram bot a message that I would receive on the terminal where this code was running.\\n\\n<details summary=\\"View Telegram API Code\\">\\n<CodeBlock\\n    language=\\"python\\"\\n    title={\\n        <a \\n            href=\\"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/telegram-text-to-bluesky-post/blob/main/experiments/telegram-api.py\\"\\n            target=\\"_blank\\"\\n            rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\"\\n            style={{ fontWeight: \'bold\', color: \'#0366d6\' }}\\n        >\\n            /experiments/telegram-api.py\\n        </a>\\n    }\\n    showLineNumbers>\\n    {`import logging\\nfrom telegram import Update\\nfrom telegram.ext import (\\n    Application,\\n    CommandHandler,\\n    MessageHandler,\\n    filters,\\n    ContextTypes,\\n)\\nimport os\\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\\nimport argparse\\n\\n# Load token from .env file\\nload_dotenv()\\nTOKEN = os.getenv(\\"TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\\")\\n\\nif not TOKEN:\\n    raise ValueError(\\"No TOKEN found in .env file\\")\\n\\n# Initialize logger\\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\\n\\n\\n# Move logging setup into a function\\ndef setup_logging(verbose: bool) -> None:\\n    level = logging.INFO if verbose else logging.WARNING\\n    logging.basicConfig(\\n        format=\\"%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\\", level=level\\n    )\\n\\n\\nasync def start(update: Update, _context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE) -> None:\\n    \\"\\"\\"Send a message when the command /start is issued.\\"\\"\\"\\n    user = update.effective_user\\n    await update.message.reply_html(\\n        f\\"Hi {user.mention_html()}! \\"\\n        f\\"I\'m a bot.

Agent brain\\n\\nI have used Ollama and `Llama3.2:latest` previously, and knew how easy it was to call the model. So I didn\'t bother spending time testing it up in advance.\\n\\n<CodeBlock\\n    language=\\"python\\"\\n>\\n    {`response = requests.post(\\n\\t\\"http://localhost:11434/api/generate\\",\\n\\tjson={\\"model\\": model, \\"prompt\\": post_prompt, \\"stream\\": False},\\n)`}\\n</CodeBlock>\\n\\nHowever, I wanted to give some form of flexibility in case someone found some interest in the project - so they could bring their own custom models.\\n\\nSo I put this code into a folder called `agents` and each file here has a class `LanguageModelWrapper`and works as an agent with (potential) access to tools.\\n\\nThe code for the `LLama3.2:latest` agent can be found here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/telegram-text-to-bluesky-post/blob/main/agents/llama_3_2_ollama.py\\n\\n### 4. Tools for the agent\\n\\nFinally, I wanted the agent to have access to a few tools, so I created a folder within agents called `tools` where I added each of these.

Put it all together\\n\\nFinally, I merged it all together in [this file](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/telegram-text-to-bluesky-post/blob/main/bluesky-agent.py).\\n\\nThis is what the architecture looks like:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2025-01-04-building-an-ai-agent-from-scratch-that-can-post-on-bluesky.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI enjoyed working on this project. It didn\'t take me much time to do it, and allowed me to learn:\\n- Utilizing Telegram API and bot convention\\n- Posting on Bluesky\\n- Playing with local models through Ollama\\n- Using xAI API for the first time - made extremely easy with OpenAI compatibility\\n\\nThe architecture I went with offers several advantages:\\n1. **Privacy**: Using a local LLM means sensitive data stays on your machine\\n2. **Customization**: The system prompt can be easily modified to change the AI\'s tone\\n3. **Reliability**: Asynchronous design prevents the bot from hanging\\n4. **Scalability**: The modular design makes it easy to add new tools or models\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis hasn\'t been heavily tested - just enough for me to test that it works end-to-end.\\n\\nOver the next few days I\'m going to play with [Eliza from ai16z](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) which I learned about only after having this implemented. It looks like it has a similar concept but agents \\"live\\" natively on X.\\n\\nAny feedback please let me know!"},{"id":"ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-12-27-ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-27-ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will.md","title":"AI chatbots won\'t revolutionize finance, but intelligent workspaces will","description":"Beyond the AI hype - why the future of financial analysis isn\'t about chatbots, but about intelligent workspaces that combine your data, tools, and AI exactly when you need them.","date":"2024-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"fintech","permalink":"/blog/tags/fintech"},{"inline":true,"label":"workspaces","permalink":"/blog/tags/workspaces"},{"inline":true,"label":"future-of-finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/future-of-finance"},{"inline":true,"label":"financial-analytics","permalink":"/blog/tags/financial-analytics"},{"inline":true,"label":"chatbots","permalink":"/blog/tags/chatbots"},{"inline":true,"label":"ui","permalink":"/blog/tags/ui"},{"inline":true,"label":"ux","permalink":"/blog/tags/ux"}],"readingTime":2.74,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will","title":"AI chatbots won\'t revolutionize finance, but intelligent workspaces will","date":"2024-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-12-27-ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will","tags":["openbb","ai","fintech","workspaces","future-of-finance","financial-analytics","chatbots","ui","ux"],"description":"Beyond the AI hype - why the future of financial analysis isn\'t about chatbots, but about intelligent workspaces that combine your data, tools, and AI exactly when you need them.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Building an AI agent from scratch that can post on bluesky","permalink":"/blog/building-an-ai-agent-from-scratch-that-can-post-on-bluesky"},"nextItem":{"title":"OpenBB and our global reach since leaving beta","permalink":"/blog/openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-12-27-ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nWhy the future of financial analysis isn\'t about chatbots, but about intelligent workspaces that combine your data, tools, and AI exactly when you need them.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nWhen ChatGPT launched, everyone rushed to build financial chatbots. But they missed two fundamental truths:\\n\\n- The best AI model is useless without access to your data.\\n- Access to data isn\'t enough - AI needs to handle complete workflows, not just conversations.\\n\\nThe limitations of most financial chatbots:\\n\\n1. They only work on a specific dataset (e.g 10-K/10-Q)\\n2. They can\'t handle complex financial workflows\\n3. They force analysts to work in an unnatural chat interface\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nHere\'s how OpenBB addresses these challenges:\\n\\nFirst, we ensure comprehensive data access:\\n\\n- Run everything on-premise or in your VPC\\n- Connect any data source: internal files, APIs, third-party feeds, market data - anything\\n- Use a universal data layer that standardizes everything (whether it\'s CSV, Excel, Snowflake, or APIs)\\n\\nBut the real innovation?\\n\\nWe\'re building AI differently.\\n\\nInstead of forcing analysts to chat with a bot, we\'re embedding intelligence directly into their workspace.\\n\\nThink dashboards with widgets, not chat windows. Data visualization, not text conversations.\\n\\nThis is exactly what Kimberly Tan (partner @ a16z) predicted in [her analysis](https://a16z.com/big-ideas-in-tech-2025/):\\n\\n> _\\"Chat was the first experimental interface \u2014 now I expect there will be new, novel interaction mechanisms. In this phase, AI agents will be able to take direct action in the workflow, and the UI will be reimagined for humans to review work or do QA.\\"_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe result?\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"1200\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-12-27-ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nA workspace where:\\n\\n- AI appears only when needed (for insights, summaries, or generating visualizations)\\n- Firms can adopt AI at their own pace\\n- Analysts keep their familiar workflows while gaining AI superpowers\\n\\nLet me show you this in action.\\n\\nLast week, I shared how [Matt from VanEck](https://x.com/mattmaximo1/status/1869413550210625818) built a powerful dashboard integrating multiple distinct data sources on OpenBB. Post with comments can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/didier-lopes_today-i-saw-a-glimpse-of-the-future-matt-activity-7275174801860636672-qoy4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).\\n\\nI only showed a screenshot of this dashboard with data.\\n\\nThere was no sign of AI in it.\\n\\nHowever, if I had simply pressed shortcut \\"Ctrl+L\\", the copilot window would have opened and I would have been able to natively interact with the data - and generate new data from it.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"1200\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-12-27-ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis demonstrates that the future of financial AI isn\'t about chatbots - it\'s about intelligent workspaces.\\n\\nAs [Jason from PyQuantNews](https://x.com/pyquantnews) astutely observes: _\\"OpenBB solves the data aggregation and centralization challenge without relying on AI, creating a ton of value from it. And then, you allow users to utilize AI in their workflows as they see fit.\\"_\\n\\nThis isn\'t just another AI product.\\n\\nIt\'s the future of financial analysis - where AI enhances your workspace instead of replacing it."},{"id":"openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-12-22-openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-22-openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta.md","title":"OpenBB and our global reach since leaving beta","description":"This is how OpenBB is reaching users worldwide with Chrome\'s translation features, making financial analytics accessible in multiple languages and expanding our presence across 84% of countries since launch.","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"fintech","permalink":"/blog/tags/fintech"},{"inline":true,"label":"growth","permalink":"/blog/tags/growth"},{"inline":true,"label":"global-audience","permalink":"/blog/tags/global-audience"},{"inline":true,"label":"internationalization","permalink":"/blog/tags/internationalization"},{"inline":true,"label":"accessibility","permalink":"/blog/tags/accessibility"},{"inline":true,"label":"translation","permalink":"/blog/tags/translation"},{"inline":true,"label":"languages","permalink":"/blog/tags/languages"}],"readingTime":1.42,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta","title":"OpenBB and our global reach since leaving beta","date":"2024-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-12-22-openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta.jpeg","tags":["openbb","fintech","growth","global-audience","internationalization","accessibility","translation","languages"],"description":"This is how OpenBB is reaching users worldwide with Chrome\'s translation features, making financial analytics accessible in multiple languages and expanding our presence across 84% of countries since launch.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"AI chatbots won\'t revolutionize finance, but intelligent workspaces will","permalink":"/blog/ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why AI analysts need human-like workspaces, not just chat interfaces","permalink":"/blog/why-ai-analysts-need-human-like-workspaces-not-just-chat-interfaces"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-12-22-openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta.jpeg\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis is how OpenBB is reaching users worldwide with Chrome\'s translation features, making financial analytics accessible in multiple languages and expanding our presence across 84% of countries since launch.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nSince our launch on October 7th, we realized that while the majority of our audience is based in the US - we have users utilizing OpenBB from all around the globe.\\n\\nIn fact, if we count sign ups since October we have a 84% country representation.\\n\\nToday, most of the top financial firms have reached out to OpenBB to learn more.

But out of the 15 PIPs done, only one was successful. All the others have resulted in a contract termination.\\n\\nThat\u2019s a success rate of less than 7%, which is extremely low.\\n\\n### Statistics\\n\\nIf we go into the machine learning domain and have a model that predicts that a team member who gets into a PIP is let go every time - this is the classification matrix that we would have.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-11-09-why-we-got-rid-of-pips-at-openbb_02.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nWhich has:\\n\\n- 93.3% precision - answers: of all the people predicted to be let go (15), how many were let go? (14)\\n\\n- 100% recall - answers: of all the people that were let go (14), how many were predicted correctly (14)\\n\\nNow, this isn\u2019t the full story.\\n\\nThis is the equivalent of a physics book treating an object as a point mass, considering the body as perfectly rigid or assuming the system is isolated with no external forces.\\n\\nSo what are the other things to consider? Let\u2019s separate these time-wise:\\n\\n1. Before a PIP happens\\n\\n2. During the PIP\\n\\n3. After the PIP\\n\\n## Before a PIP\\n\\nBefore someone starts a PIP, their performance has already been subpar.\\n\\nBy definition, performance is a lagging indicator, which means you are already late when you catch this person not pulling as much value as others.\\n\\nParticularly when you consider that the person who would be initiating the PIP is the team lead (TL)/manager and isn\u2019t working as closely with this person as others on a daily basis. Hence, coworkers are likely to see firsthand this suboptimal performance in advance of the team lead or manager.\\n\\nSo, the suboptimal performance from this person over a few days or weeks is likely to go unnoticed and slow down the company.\\n\\nIn addition, individual contributors (ICs) who work closely with this person are likely to notice this before the TL/manager, thus impacting their motivation.\\n\\n***\\"If this person can get the same compensation as I do for average work, why am I putting in so much time and effort?\\"***\\n\\nHonestly, if there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s that A players get motivated by other A players (\u201cA players attract A players\u201d).\\n\\n## During a PIP\\n\\nA PIP takes time. **A LOT of it.**\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s the one thing that startups don\u2019t have.\\n\\nImagine that you have the following org:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-11-09-why-we-got-rid-of-pips-at-openbb_03.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nIf an IC is underperforming, the TL will discuss it with the IC in advance.\\n\\nThen the team lead may ask for feedback from other ICs who work with the IC in question.\\n\\nAfter that, the TL will talk with the Director about this before initiating the PIP.\\n\\nThen the Director will mention this to the CEO of the company.\\n\\nThe CEO will likely want to talk with the team lead about this, given that in an organization of 15 people, each team member accounts for more than 5% of the org.\\n\\nNow, you may be thinking, \u201cBut this happens before the PIP\u201d.\\n\\nThis happens before and continues throughout the entire PIP. But, during the PIP, it\u2019s even worse because there are regular meetings for a shorter feedback loop, and there needs to be documentation on the progress.\\n\\nSo yes, this not only takes a lot of time, but it\u2019s also a distraction to the team.\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s the other thing that companies need: \u201cfocus\u201d.\\n\\nYou can\u2019t fully focus at 100% when you know that someone is \u201cfighting\u201d for their job. And not being able to focus impacts each individual\u2019s performance.\\n\\nSo this inefficiency ends up spreading across the team.\\n\\n## After the PIP\\n### Needs to be let go\\n\\nOk, someone was underperforming and needs to be let go.\\n\\nThe company needs to figure out:\\n\\n- How many options this person has vested and handle the paperwork if they want to buy them\\n\\n- Whether they have company equipment that needs to be returned\\n\\n- What the severance package will be\\n\\n- How to handle the news and how the team will react\\n\\nAgain, this will be a distraction for at least an additional week and will affect other team members, who may be surprised by this.\\n\\nParticularly because, most of the time, they aren\u2019t aware that the PIP is happening and from their perspective, someone they liked to work with was let go.\\n\\n### Has a successful PIP\\n\\nLet\u2019s be honest, these cases are very rare.\\n\\nNot just at OpenBB. I\u2019ve spoken with other founders, and this is the same feedback I\u2019ve received.\\n\\nBut let\u2019s ignore that, we already mentioned it at the start.\\n\\nSomeone on a PIP\u2014almost by definition\u2014isn\u2019t a high performer. They could be a high performer in some parts of the job, but not as a whole. However, this is the exception, not the rule.\\n\\nThe rule, often, is that this person has been doing just enough to be competent at the company\u2014but not excel. Then, over a period of time, due to internal reasons, lack of motivation, etc., they fall below that threshold.\\n\\nThis means that even after a successful PIP, you are putting all of these resources toward getting\u2014not a high performer, but a B+ player.\\n\\nAnd ultimately, this is why we are getting rid of the PIP at OpenBB.\\n\\nBeing **\u201cgood enough\u201d** isn\u2019t the culture we want for OpenBB and doesn\u2019t represent our team today. If you let the bar slip, you won\u2019t even realize it until it\u2019s too late.\\n\\nAgain, performance is a lagging indicator and can have both positive and negative effects on the team\u2014so it\u2019s important to protect the team from poor performers.\\n\\nThere are two exceptions to this:\\n\\n**1. Imagine that this person can turn their output into 4x, imagine they had a wake-up call.**\\n\\nSeveral questions need to be asked:\\n\\n- If this person can perform at this level, why weren\'t they doing it before?\\n\\n- How long will they maintain this level of performance?\\n\\n- Will we need to have another serious conversation to get this person to reach this level of competency again at a later stage?\\n\\n- Will they always resent the company because of the PIP?\\n\\nIt all boils down to this: if this person isn\u2019t motivated by what we\u2019re building, regardless of their skill set, they weren\u2019t a good fit in the first place.\\n\\nWe\u2019re fortunate to have a pipeline of people applying for positions at OpenBB, not just for the money but for the product and the mission of the company.\\n\\n**2. The person is a high performer but has been performing poorly in some areas of the job (e.g. communications, testing, documentation, \u2026)**\\n\\nThis person had likely received feedback multiple times, but the PIP made it more real: *\u201cThis is what we are looking for in a person for your role; you have 2-3 weeks to prove that you can double down on your weaknesses and reach the level the team needs you to be at.\u201d*\\n\\nThis is what happened to us, and the person improved significantly, so much so that they are now a core part of who OpenBB is today.\\n\\nThis success story was one of the main reasons we continued doing PIPs.\\n\\nBut the likelihood of it happening again is so low that it\u2019s not worth keeping PIP to look for another success story like this one.\\n\\n## So what\u2019s next?\\n### How we think about talent level at OpenBB\\n\\nLet\u2019s say you define company\u2019s talent value as the sum of the talent of each individual divided by the total number of team members.\\n\\nThere are two ways to increase this value:\\n\\n- Hire people who are above OpenBB\u2019s talent level\\n\\n- Let go of people who fall below the talent level\\n\\nOr, ideally, do both.\\n\\nThe problem is that for the first option, you often need **a LOT** of capital.\\n\\nFor the second, you don\u2019t. Not only that but letting go of low performers will accomplish two things simultaneously:\\n\\n- Increase OpenBB\u2019s talent level immediately.\\n\\n- Free up resources that can be invested in someone above OpenBB\u2019s current talent value (assuming that companies should always seek high performers and avoid settling for underperformers).\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s why removing PIPs leads to an increase in the company\u2019s talent level. You\u2019re not just increasing the talent level once, but likely twice.\\n\\nHere\u2019s an example:\\n\\nImagine we have 5 people at OpenBB with talent scores of 2, 7, 7, 7, and 9. Then OpenBB\u2019s talent level is:\\n\\n(2+7+7+7+9)/5 = 6.4\\n\\nIf we let go of the employee with a talent score of 2, our talent level becomes 7.4. Then, if we bring in someone with a score of 8 using the same resources, that talent level increases to 7.6.\\n\\nYou get the idea.\\n\\n### What the team can expect?\\n\\nFull transparency.\\n\\nWe want to build a culture where feedback is an ever-present element, and we don\u2019t need to wait for performance reviews to give feedback that can substantially improve team performance and push the company forward.\\n\\nIn fact, not sharing this feedback puts the company in a worse position, and it is your duty to share it. But do so with candor, in a constructive manner that keeps the team member motivated.\\n\\nHowever, each team member must care. This means you can\u2019t rely solely on your team lead to give you feedback every day\u2014you need to ask for it regularly. That\u2019s the best way for you to grow.\\n\\n## Final notes\\n\\nWe made this decision after reading *No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention*, where they also removed PIPs.\\n\\nUnlike Netflix, we don\u2019t have the resources to:\\n\\n- Pay top of the market\\n\\n- Offer a generous severance\\n\\nWe still pay good salaries, just not enough to compete with public companies. This means we need to spend much more time finding diamonds in the rough.\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s why we have a higher turnover; finding diamonds in the rough is much riskier.\\n\\nIn any case, I think optimizing to pay top of the market is misguided\u2014at least for startups\u2014as it incentivizes the wrong type of talent.\\n\\nIt incentivizes mercenaries instead of missionaries.\\n\\nAt an early stage, you need people who want a lot of ownership and autonomy, who are excited to work with a team and on a product they believe in, and who have a chip on their shoulders.\\n\\nRegardless of the startup, I have yet to see someone with this mentality who doesn\u2019t end up being successful.\\n\\n**Note**: Most of the people who were let go would be considered good employees in most companies today, and they had strong referrals. But companies have different types of needs that evolve over time, and as founders, it\u2019s our role to look at the company as a whole and understand what it needs at the moment and, more importantly, what it will need in the coming months and years."},{"id":"implement-feedback-loops-everywhere-you-can","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/implement-feedback-loops-everywhere-you-can","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-10-25-implement-feedback-loops-everywhere-you-can.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-25-implement-feedback-loops-everywhere-you-can.md","title":"Implement feedback loops EVERYWHERE you can","description":"Maximizing team transparency through focused feedback sessions.","date":"2024-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"management","permalink":"/blog/tags/management"},{"inline":true,"label":"leadership","permalink":"/blog/tags/leadership"},{"inline":true,"label":"feedback","permalink":"/blog/tags/feedback"},{"inline":true,"label":"transparency","permalink":"/blog/tags/transparency"},{"inline":true,"label":"culture","permalink":"/blog/tags/culture"},{"inline":true,"label":"remote-work","permalink":"/blog/tags/remote-work"}],"readingTime":5.51,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"implement-feedback-loops-everywhere-you-can","title":"Implement feedback loops EVERYWHERE you can","date":"2024-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-10-25-implement-feedback-loops-everywhere-you-can.jpeg","tags":["openbb","management","leadership","feedback","transparency","culture","remote-work"],"description":"Maximizing team transparency through focused feedback sessions.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why we got rid of PIPs at OpenBB","permalink":"/blog/why-we-got-rid-of-pips-at-openbb"},"nextItem":{"title":"OpenBB Mobile App - Coming soon","permalink":"/blog/openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-25-implement-feedback-loops-everywhere-you-can.jpeg\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nMaximizing team transparency through focused feedback sessions.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nA couple of months ago, my co-founder came to NYC for our board meeting.\\n\\nDuring that week, we took a day to sync up with everyone on the team\u2014literally.

Several people highlighted that they felt that their manager cared about them based on conversations about their personal life and personal development.\\n\\n- Feedback should go both ways, the manager/leader appreciates when feedback is provided.\\n\\n- Setting up expectations clearly for each individual is critical. People appreciate when they know exactly what is expected of them, so they understand how their value is perceived from the company\'s perspective.\\n\\n### Rituals\\n\\n- Monthly update emails are very good. Sometimes even more details would be better.\\n\\n- Some people are so focused on execution that they try to protect their time at all costs. It\'s important to respect this decision and default to async text-based conversations instead of setting up a meeting\\n\\n- Dogfood the product from people from different backgrounds is important as it gives different points of view that we can leverage to make our product better\\n\\n### Communicatiions\\n\\n- Be aware of different comms styles throughout org. In general, people have shared that they appreciate when others send them a DM with feedback based on a conversation in a public channel.\\n\\n- Sometimes team members need to put themselves in the shoes of other people first instead of defaulting to defence.\\n\\n- We shouldn\'t compromise on quality. We should aim to agree first on the best solution and then adapt if there\'s a lack of resources, but knowing what the best solution is and what is the trade-off that is being made\\n\\n- When a conversation is taking a few messages back and forth, sometimes a quick huddle should be done\\n\\n- Making sure that all stakeholders are involved regarding features or changes in the product before any green light is given to execute. It happened that a green light was given, mockups were created based on that context and the engineering team added the feature. Only for that to get pushed back because a stakeholder that wasn\'t involved in the discussion saw the final result on Slack chat.\\n\\n### Transparency\\n\\n- More transparency when deals are closed - e.g. what are they interested in, how many seats, what do they do on a day-to-day basis\\n\\n- When mentioning increased transparency, the vast majority of people think that our level of transparency is very high.\\n\\n- A common answer: \\"If I have any questions I know can just DM you and you will answer\\"\\n\\n- Add a Q&A at the end of the status update where everyone can put questions to be answered\\n\\n- A common answer: \\"I don\'t like when someone leaves out of a sudden\\". Unfortunately, we can\'t do anything here. We\'ve also asked for feedback on what we could do better, but people understood that there\'s not much we can do. This is a conversation between the person and the manager and it\'s unfair for the person being let go if we share their personal information. There\'s a PIP and that means that before everyone leaves the company they are in 3-4 weeks PIP, where expectations are set clearly and their continuity depends on their output.\\n\\n- People appreciate feedback a lot, regardless of if it\'s positive or not. It\'s the best way for them to improve.\\n\\n### Thoughts\\n\\nI think, at an early stage, everyone should do this. And maybe even at a later stage but in each subset of the org.\\n\\nOne of the reasons I think this worked so well is that for the first 20 minutes, you are asking the exact same questions to everyone and so that allows you to get answers that you can compare across the board.\\n\\nThen, once those 20 minutes are over, the team member feels that they have already been so transparent that they openly ask questions that they are curious about.\\n\\nThe final result was a presentation with all the combined learnings and actionable.\\n\\n**What do you think?**"},{"id":"openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon.md","title":"OpenBB Mobile App - Coming soon","description":"How we built a mobile app, in 1 evening, with 1 engineer.","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"mobile-app","permalink":"/blog/tags/mobile-app"},{"inline":true,"label":"pwa","permalink":"/blog/tags/pwa"},{"inline":true,"label":"web-development","permalink":"/blog/tags/web-development"},{"inline":true,"label":"ux","permalink":"/blog/tags/ux"},{"inline":true,"label":"engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/engineering"},{"inline":true,"label":"startup-culture","permalink":"/blog/tags/startup-culture"},{"inline":true,"label":"rapid-prototyping","permalink":"/blog/tags/rapid-prototyping"}],"readingTime":4.48,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon","title":"OpenBB Mobile App - Coming soon","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon.png","tags":["openbb","mobile-app","pwa","web-development","ux","engineering","startup-culture","rapid-prototyping"],"description":"How we built a mobile app, in 1 evening, with 1 engineer.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Implement feedback loops EVERYWHERE you can","permalink":"/blog/implement-feedback-loops-everywhere-you-can"},"nextItem":{"title":"ChatGPT and The Future of AI in Finance","permalink":"/blog/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nHow we built a mobile app, in 1 evening, with 1 engineer.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nLet\'s start with a bit of background to this story. \ud83d\udcd6\\n\\nBack in September 2021, our first full-time team member was [Jose Donato](https://x.com/josedonato__?utm_source=didierlopes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon). He started full-time, even before I did (due to my 3 months notice period in Europe, yikes).\\n\\nWe met through Reddit, only to discover that we are both Portuguese and our hometowns aren\'t far from each other.\\n\\nI\'ve learned more from him about web development than from any YouTube, tutorial or book - combined.\\n\\nOne of the topics he was very passionate about, was the concept of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). So much so, that he talked about it in his thesis ([2.2 native applications](https://jose-donato.deno.dev/master_thesis.pdf?utm_source=didierlopes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon)).\\n\\nI had never heard of it before, but the concept intrigued me. Why wouldn\'t more companies do that?\\n\\nJose is currently writing a post about it, you can subscribe to the [company newsletter](https://openbb.co/newsletter?utm_source=didierlopes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon) to keep an eye out for it.\\n\\n## Mobile compatibility\\n\\nFast forward to September 3rd, 2024. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\\n\\nWe are 1 week away from one of the biggest launches in the company. Earlier surprise for my subscribers, but we are about to announce a free version of our enterprise product.\\n\\nA web app that allows users to bring any type of data and have access to an agent to interact with all these different datasets to extract patterns, trends and insights.\\n\\nThis web app has been built over 2 years and all workflows, tests, and iterations have been done for desktop usage.\\n\\nJose sent me a video of a mobile version somewhat polished. It had the same UX as the terminal, but it rendered nicely on mobile.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nGiven that we were aiming at adoption, he believed it was important for users to be able to access the terminal through their phones on the web.\\n\\nAnd so over 2 weeks, he spent no more than 3h polishing the mobile version.\\n\\n## Mobile UX\\n\\nOn the 23rd of September, I pinged [Rita Soares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-rita-soares-48b247152/?utm_source=didierlopes.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon) - our lead UI/UX.\\n\\nI had been thinking about mobile user experience and wasn\'t happy that we just adapted the interface to work with mobile. But, mobile represents a completely different paradigm on how we use a product. The screen space, the speed at which you can type, not necessarily used for work, more distractions, etc...\\n\\nSo, I asked Rita to create a few mobile mockups for me - the idea was to improve the UX to make the copilot shine. I.e. more front and center and have the data visualization pushed more to the background.\\n\\nThat same evening, she shared these mockups with me:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nI promptly shared in a group with her and Jose - this was 7:35 pm my time, which would be 0:35 am their time.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_4.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nIn less than 24 hours the bulk of the mockups had been implemented.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_5.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)\\n\\nOn that same day, after Jose shared the bulk of mockups implemented.\\n\\nI sent him this message at 8:55 pm EST (1:55 am Portugal time for Jose).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_7.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nTo which he replied:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_8.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nI was right, it didn\'t take him 30s. But it didn\'t take him much longer (15 minutes).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_9.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n15 minutes to have OpenBB as an application on my phone.\\n\\nI was mind-blown.\\n\\nWe iterated on it for an additional 1h30m together, until we had something we would be proud to share with the team the following day.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_10.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nWe still had to iterate on a few more areas and involve more people from the team. But the bulk of the mobile app was done.\\n\\nIn pretty much 1 evening.\\n\\nWith 1 person.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI could tell you that this doesn\'t happen often, but it does.\\n\\nSmall, highly motivated teams (or individuals like Jose) with a strong initiative and a drive to make a difference, can have a tremendous impact on the company.\\n\\nI hope this post inspires more builders to share behind the scenes on how great products/features are built and how serendipity can play a role in it."},{"id":"chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance.md","title":"ChatGPT and The Future of AI in Finance","description":"I took the stage at the Cornell Quant Conference alongside Yu Yu (BlackRock) Tony Berkman (Two Sigma), and Samson Qian (Citadel), to discuss ChatGPT & The Future of AI in Finance.","date":"2024-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"fintech","permalink":"/blog/tags/fintech"},{"inline":true,"label":"llm","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"inline":true,"label":"agents","permalink":"/blog/tags/agents"},{"inline":true,"label":"hallucinations","permalink":"/blog/tags/hallucinations"},{"inline":true,"label":"fine-tuning","permalink":"/blog/tags/fine-tuning"},{"inline":true,"label":"data-security","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-security"},{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"thought-leadership","permalink":"/blog/tags/thought-leadership"}],"readingTime":17.27,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance","title":"ChatGPT and The Future of AI in Finance","date":"2024-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance.jpg","tags":["ai","fintech","llm","agents","hallucinations","fine-tuning","data-security","openbb","thought-leadership"],"description":"I took the stage at the Cornell Quant Conference alongside Yu Yu (BlackRock) Tony Berkman (Two Sigma), and Samson Qian (Citadel), to discuss ChatGPT & The Future of AI in Finance.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"OpenBB Mobile App - Coming soon","permalink":"/blog/openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon"},"nextItem":{"title":"Why I love boxing","permalink":"/blog/why-i-love-boxing"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance.jpg\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nI took the stage at the Cornell Quant Conference alongside Yu Yu (BlackRock) Tony Berkman (Two Sigma), and Samson Qian (Citadel), to discuss ChatGPT & The Future of AI in Finance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nLast week, I participated in a panel at the Cornell Financial Engineering Manhattan Conference. The topic of the panel was \'ChatGPT & The Future of AI in Finance.\'\\n\\nThe other panelists were:\\n\\n- **Yu Yu**, Director of Data Science - BlackRock\\n- **Tony Berkman**, Managing Director - Two Sigma\\n- **Samson Qian**, Trader - Citadel\\n\\nAfter the discussion, several people reached out, mentioning it was one of their favorite panels of the day.\\n\\nSince this wasn\'t recorded, I took the opportunity to write down some of the topics discussed, along with a few additional thoughts that I believe in.\\n\\nI will organize the following sections based on the topics discussed at the event:\\n\\n1. Hallucinations\\n2. Agents are the future\\n3. When does it make sense to fine-tune?\\n4. Compliance and Data security\\n\\n## 1. Hallucinations\\n\\nWhen talking about the topic of hallucinations, I have a [quote](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1675630822093918209) that I love from Marc Andreesen:\\n\\n> \\"Hallucination is what we call when we don\'t like it. Creativity is what we call it when we do like it.\\"\\n\\n### Confident hallucinations\\n\\nThe fundamental issue with hallucinations is the fact that the model hallucinates with confidence.\\n\\nImagine asking two different friends: \\"Do you know where location X is?\\"\\n\\n**Friend A**: It\'s there.\\n\\n**Friend B**: Hmm, I\'m not really sure. If I had to guess, I\'d say there, but I\'m not 100% certain.\\n\\nIf both gave wrong directions, you would consider **Friend A** a liar, but not Friend B. This is because **Friend B** lacked confidence in their answer, they were trying to help but highlighted that they weren\'t sure about it.\\n\\nThe problem with current LLMs is that they are, for the most part, like **Friend A**. They say wrong things with certainty.\\n\\nHallucinations would be less problematic if the default behavior were more like the answer on the right, when the LLM is not 100% confident.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex justify-center items-center\\">\\n  <img width=\\"350\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_1.png\\" style={{marginRight: \'10px\'}}/>\\n  <img width=\\"350\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_2.png\\"/>\\n</div>\\n<br />\\n\\nThe problem with confident hallucinations is that, similar to why everyone dislikes liars, it leads to a lack of trust. So users begin to put everything that is output by an LLM under a microscope - even if what the model says is accurate.\\n\\n### How to avoid hallucinations\\n\\nThere are ways to address this and one of the key approaches we are extremely strong about at OpenBB is always tapping into information that is available.\\n\\nWhen a user asks a question that requires financial data, the OpenBB Copilot always searches for that data on OpenBB (either through data we make available or through private data that customers bring).\\n\\nThe Copilot will only answer the question if that data exists. This allows the model to cite the data used in its response, so the user can double-check.\\n\\nThis is how it looks.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nWhile I\'ve heard a few vendors promising 100% accuracy, this is simply not true.\\n\\nWe are at a stage where technology is not even yet at the \'trust but verify\' level.\\n\\nSo instead of hallucinating with confidence, when data is unavailable, we prompt the model to return that there was no real-time information accessible to answer the query.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_4.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Function calling to increase accuracy\\n\\nOne thing we found that significantly reduces hallucinations is enabling our agent, OpenBB Copilot, to have access to all the API backends that users have through OpenBB or those they\'ve added themselves.\\n\\nHere\'s the sequence of actions that happen:\\n\\n1. The user asks the OpenBB Copilot a question.\\n2. The prompt is converted into embeddings.\\n3. We compare that embedding with all the ones that we have on an OpenBB vector store which contains widget signatures - name, description, category, subcategory and source.\\n4. We retrieve the widgets with the highest similarity.\\n5. The Copilot then decides which widget to use based on the prompt.\\n6. Then Copilot also decides what parameters to use when calling that API\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis leads to less hallucination because the LLM isn\'t outputting tokens based on a prompt and its internal weights. Instead, it\'s using its internal weights, the prompt, and a function call.\\n\\nAssuming the function call succeeds - with correct widget retrieval and parameters - the data becomes available for the Copilot to use, which leads to higher accuracy.\\n\\nNote: This still means that Copilot needs to use the correct widget and the correct parameter, but there\'s a **higher likelihood of success** because if it isn\'t, the API call will fail, prompting the LLM to try again.\\n\\nHere\'s how it works behind the scenes, the OpenBB Copilot highlights its step-by-step reasoning so users can understand its thought process. Transparency is key.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_5.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Workflows to avoid hallucinations\\n\\nIn order to reduce the number of hallucinations, there are two things that can be done.\\n\\n#### Enable users to quickly detect whether a hallucination has occurred\\n\\nFor instance, if a user utilizes the following prompt on the OpenBB Copilot:\\n\\n>_Using the earnings transcript, create a table with columns: financial metric, value, sentence in the earnings where it was extracted from. Double check whether the information you are using is correct._\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThey get the \\"_Sentence Extracted From_\\" column, which they can copy and paste into a search field added at the top of the Earnings Transcript widget. This enable users to quickly validate the numbers that have been found.\\n\\nSee example below,\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_6.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n#### Add deterministic processes to check for hallucinations\\n\\nFor example, let\'s say the user prompt involves a data retrieval task.\\n\\nWe can run a deterministic process to check whether the retrieved values exist or not. Sure this won\'t be 100% accurate because the numbers could be flagged by referring to another thing, BUT it\'s all about improving the overall accuracy of Copilot.\\n\\nUltimately, whatever can be done to improve the Copilot\'s accuracy should be done.\\n\\n## 2. Agents are the future\\n\\nWhen we think about how humans operate, we recognize that the brain coordinates all the actions of our body and our thought processes. This is similar to how agents work.\\n\\nIf I\'m playing soccer, the muscles I use are different from those I would use if I were boxing. If I\'m programming, the parts of my brain I use differ from those I would use when listening to music.\\n\\nHowever, it\'s not as simple as \\"activity A requires legs\\". Most of your body and mind are always involved, but at different times and in different capacities. And what dictates that are external factors.\\n\\nFor instance, if I am playing soccer as a winger and my team is attacking, I will likely be using both legs to run forward and a lot of mental energy to decide where to position myself on the field.\\n\\nAnd that will change a lot based on where the ball is. If the ball is on the opposite side, I\'ll likely run less and stay more in the middle to be ready for a counterattack. If the ball is in the middle, I\'ll probably be running at full speed to create space. If the ball is close to me I have to worry more about controlling it and understand what I can do with it next.\\n\\nThe environment affects my plan to carry out an action where I want to have a successful outcome.\\n\\n**This is how agents work.**\\n\\nAgents aren\'t just about a single LLM performing well, but about a full workflow that interacts with multiple language models, function calls, or any other process to carry an action.\\n\\nAt the core, the biggest advantage of an agent over a LLM is that an agent has a full feedback loop. It understands the impact of the LLM output and can use that data in the next step of the process. Whereas a single LLM API call returns its best output but won\'t know how that affected the external environment.\\n\\nThis is why, at OpenBB, we believe in compound AI systems.\\n\\nAnd apparently, [so does Sequoia](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sequoia-sees-bigger-money-ai-203655254.html?guccounter=1).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_7.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### The \\"Strawberry\\" issue will be solved\\n\\nA panelist commented on stage that LLMs can\'t even count how many R\'s are in the word \\"Strawberry\\".\\n\\nThis [tweet](https://x.com/MwangoCapital/status/1828857579860095428) offers a good explanation of why this happens \u2014 it turns out it\'s due to the tokenizer, and it can be solved. In fact, it\'s solved by simply ensuring that the model takes each letter as a token. See below,\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex justify-center items-center\\">\\n  <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_8.png\\" style={{marginRight: \'10px\'}}/>\\n  <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_9.png\\"/>\\n</div>\\n<br />\\n\\nThis means that the model\'s output can be improved by doing extra work at the input level.\\n\\nData cleaning and pre-processing strikes again? \ud83d\ude03\\n\\nInterestingly, a few days ago, [OpenAI announced OpenAI o1](https://openai.com/o1/). Which is basically GPT-4o with Chain-of-Thought (COT). This means that this model is a \\"wannabe agent\\".\\n\\nIt takes in a prompt from the user and decomposes it in natural steps to solve it. Then at each step, it takes the output of the model from the previous step and predicts the next token. It turns out that this improves accuracy substantially.\\n\\nHowever, it still doesn\'t have access to external data. And that is why I call it a \\"wannabe agent\\".\\n\\nI love how Jeremiah put it in this [tweet](https://x.com/jlowin/status/1834722014839418962):\\n\\n> (...) Agents are also characterized by iterative behavior. But there\'s a key difference: while models like o1 iterate internally to refine their reasoning, agents engage in iterative interactions with the external world. They perceive the environment, take actions, observe the outcomes (or side effects) and adjust accordingly. This recursive process enables agents to handle tasks that require adaptability and responsiveness to real-world changes. (...)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nSo, o1\'s model isn\'t an agent - but it can solve this problem. The reason is that it applies its own data cleaning/pre-processing step on its own, and doesn\'t rely on external factors.\\n\\n### Small Language Models\\n\\nOnce agents work, Small Language Models (SLM) will be much more viable for very specific use cases.\\n\\nIn logical terms, a Large Language Model is a model with weights.\\n\\nLarge means that it has a lot of them. But what tends to happen is LLMs need to be very big because they want these models to be really good at everything. The problem is that if you want the exact same model to be good at discussing soccer, programming, and speaking Portuguese, its weights are updated using these drastically different datasets. Now the premise is that the more weights there are, the less each weight will be affected by data from completely different domains.\\n\\nWhat a big LLM like GPT-4o is doing is trying to build a single Jarvis that knows about everything. Whereas we could have an SLM that does something extremely well and just focus on that, e.g. translating from English to Portuguese. The benefit of an SLM is that inference is likely faster, can be hosted on devices, and, in theory, it\'s better on a topic because it\'s been less \\"contaminated\\" during training by data that doesn\'t relate to the task at hand.\\n\\nImagine that a firm decides to use an SLM trained to retrieve data from SEC filings quickly and at scale. Or, we could train our own SLM to understand user intent and interact directly with the OpenBB Terminal interface.\\n\\n### Large Language Models as orchestrator\\n\\nIn my opinion, the best LLM in each category will win. And the second and third won\'t matter. It\'s a winner-takes-all kind of market. Unless in specific verticals such as inference time or open weights (e.g. for data security; more on this later).\\n\\nThe best example of this is OpenAI vs Anthropic.\\n\\nI had been using OpenAI\'s GPT-4 for coding for several months. After trying Anthropic\'s Sonnet 3.5 for coding, I never went back to OpenAI.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"400\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_10.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThe market share for the best LLM will be gigantic. That\'s why [OpenAI is looking to raise at a $150 billion valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-11/openai-fundraising-set-to-vault-startup\'s-value-to-150-billion). While the valuation reflects the market size, the amount that will be raised represents the capital needed to reach that valuation. This is why only a few players will be able to compete at that level.\\n\\nIn an \\"agentic future\\", I believe the best LLM will serve as the core \\"brain\\" - the main LLM that routes all prompts and decides what happens next.\\n\\nAnd who wouldn\'t want the smartest model controlling the actions with a list of models, functions and data at its disposal?\\n\\nI know I would.\\n\\nThat\'s also why, when discussing OpenBB Copilot, we don\'t rely on a single foundational model. Instead, we use the models that are best suited for each specific task.\\n\\nFor instance, OpenAI o1 can be the brains, but when a user uses @web it triggers the Perplexity model, and when they upload an image, we have Anthropic\'s Haiku. Or maybe if they want to do intraday trading, we use Llama 3.1 through Groq for fast inference.\\n\\nYou get the idea.\\n\\n## 3. When does it make sense to fine-tune\\n\\nA good comment was made on the panel: \\"_it\'s expensive to spend time fine-tuning a new model, just for that entire work to be \'eradicated\' by a new model that has a higher performance in that specific domain than the model has been fine-tuned_\\".\\n\\nIn my opinion, this happens because the timing isn\'t right yet. We are still unlocking remarkable achievements through each new model release. Although there is a massive bump in terms of capability between these releases, I wouldn\'t recommend that a firm fine-tune its own models at this stage.\\n\\nHowever, at some point, whether due to a lack of data to train or architecture needing to be reinvented, improvements in LLM performance won\'t be substantial - they may not even be noticeable. This is when the fine-tuning technique becomes relevant because at this stage you are trying to repurpose everything the model has towards a specific vertical / use-case - and at that vertical/use-case that model will be better than the following one.\\n\\nThen after some new models come out, you may consider reapplying fine-tuning to that model, but this would likely be years later, not weeks or months. So, the ROI can be quite high. Particularly when you are trying to win in your specific market.\\n\\nThis is how I see it working in my head:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_11.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## 4. Compliance and Data security\\n\\nAnother question I received was about compliance and data security.\\n\\nRecently, during a discussion with one of the largest hedge funds in the world, we were asked about the entire workflow of the data when our AI Copilot has access to it.\\n\\nTheir main concern was ensuring that no data was being shared with third-party vendors like OpenAI. For such firms, their data is their alpha, and keeping it within their network is paramount.\\n\\nCrypto enthusiasts often say, \\"Not your keys, not your coins\\" to emphasize the importance of storing assets in a cold wallet rather than leaving them on an exchange that might implode (looking at you, FTX). The same principle applies here: \\"Not your weights, not your data\\".\\n\\nWhen you send information to a large foundation model provider like OpenAI, your data enters their ecosystem, and you have to trust they\'ll honor the terms of your contract.\\n\\nA more secure approach is to host an open-source model locally within your firm, ensuring that sensitive data remains entirely within your infrastructure and network.\\n\\nAlthough open-source models aren\'t yet as powerful as closed-source ones, they are catching up quickly. If you think that GPT-4o can already do a lot for you, think about how at some point there will be an open-source model that is GPT-4o equivalent. Sure, at that time closed-source models will be better, but the question is: How much better?\\n\\nOr better, the question is: **\\"How much are you willing to sacrifice in terms of data security for performance?\\"**.\\n\\nAt OpenBB, we take this very seriously and have taken measures to allow enterprise customers to fully control their data.\\n\\n### Bring your own copilot\\n\\nEnable firms to bring their own LLMs to access data within OpenBB. This means that we provide an interface for research, but also allow them to integrate their internal LLMs and interact directly with it from OpenBB.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex justify-center items-center\\">\\n  <img width=\\"350\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_12.png\\" style={{marginRight: \'10px\'}}/>\\n  <img width=\\"350\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_13.png\\"/>\\n</div>\\n<br />\\n\\nWe believe in this idea so much, that we have open-source the architecture for firms to bring their own Copilot to OpenBB. More information is available [here](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/copilot-for-terminal-pro/).\\n\\n### Turn off AI workflows\\n\\nWe have incorporated workflows that make users\' lives MUCH better. But they come at a cost: sharing data with an LLM provider.\\n\\nThese are the features:\\n\\n- **Widget title/description suggestion from Copilot**: This sends the content of the table or note output by Copilot to an LLM provider to receive suggestions of a title and description.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_14.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n- **Widget title/description suggestion upon upload**: It sends the content of the file that has been uploaded to an LLM provider to receive suggestions of title and description.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_15.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n- **Copilot chat title generation**: Upon the first user prompt, the content is sent to an LLM provider to update the chat title, reflecting the nature of the conversation.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_16.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n- **Dashboard name generation**: When renaming the dashboard, we send the title and descriptions of all widgets on that dashboard to an LLM provider, to ensure that the suggested name is relevant.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_17.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nTo allow firms to keep their data within their network, one of our enterprise features is the option to disable these AI workflows.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_18.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nIn the future, we could direct these AI workflows to use an LLM that our customers are running locally.\\n\\n## So, in a nutshell, what can you expect from OpenBB?\\n\\nWe are building an AI-powered research workspace.\\n\\nAt the core it is an AI compound system, where users can bring their own data (structured, unstructured, API, custom backend, database, data warehouse, etc..) and have our (or their own copilot) access all this data seamlessly - in an interface that is customizable, flexible and enables teams to work together.\\n\\nIf you want to learn more, e-mail me directly at didier.lopes@openbb.finance"},{"id":"why-i-love-boxing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/why-i-love-boxing","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing.md","title":"Why I love boxing","description":"Exploring the parallels between boxing and startup life, and how both push me beyond my comfort zone to foster personal growth, resilience, and continuous learning.","date":"2024-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"boxing","permalink":"/blog/tags/boxing"},{"inline":true,"label":"startup","permalink":"/blog/tags/startup"},{"inline":true,"label":"personal-growth","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal-growth"},{"inline":true,"label":"learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/learning"},{"inline":true,"label":"resilience","permalink":"/blog/tags/resilience"},{"inline":true,"label":"comfort-zone","permalink":"/blog/tags/comfort-zone"},{"inline":true,"label":"mindset","permalink":"/blog/tags/mindset"},{"inline":true,"label":"philosophy","permalink":"/blog/tags/philosophy"},{"inline":true,"label":"life-lessons","permalink":"/blog/tags/life-lessons"}],"readingTime":5.14,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"why-i-love-boxing","title":"Why I love boxing","date":"2024-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing.jpeg","tags":["boxing","startup","personal-growth","learning","resilience","comfort-zone","mindset","philosophy","life-lessons"],"description":"Exploring the parallels between boxing and startup life, and how both push me beyond my comfort zone to foster personal growth, resilience, and continuous learning.","hideSidebar":true},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"ChatGPT and The Future of AI in Finance","permalink":"/blog/chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance"},"nextItem":{"title":"What I learned in 3 Years at OpenBB","permalink":"/blog/what-i-learned-in-3-years-at-openb"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing.jpeg\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nExploring the parallels between boxing and startup life, and how both push me beyond my comfort zone to foster personal growth, resilience, and continuous learning.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nRecently, I finished reading \\"The Art of Learning\\" -

and how anyone can master the art of learning.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nIt made me wonder, why at 29 years old did I decide to step into a ring with boxers who have been fighting for 10+ years? \ud83e\udd4a\\n\\nAs my friend Max says, \\"You don\'t play boxing\\". So why am I doing it?\\n\\nSimilar to setting up a startup, this isn\'t something that\'s easy to explain. The most rationale thing to do would be to go for a run outside or just go to the gym.\\n\\nYet, I hop in a ring to fight.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nFor starters, there\'s something thrilling about stepping into the ring and knowing that you are going to get punched.\\n\\nYou need to get comfortable with something that - by definition - it\'s uncomfortable.\\n\\n## Boxing is the physical to what startups are for the mind\\n\\nThink about it. Most activities that people do in their spare time have a \\"controlled\\" level of intensity. You get progressively more tired but \\"know\\" it\'s coming - e.g. gym, swimming, tennis, running, etc.\\n\\nContact sports are in general like this too, although every now and then you can get injured. Although this rate is small, and sports in general equip athletes to be protected against injuries.\\n\\nBoxing (and martial arts) don\'t work this way. You step in the ring and within the first few seconds, you may get a hook that gives you a bruise next to your eye or a uppercut that makes you stop breathing for a few seconds.\\n\\nMy point is that with boxing, you don\'t know when you are going to get hurt, but you learn to be comfortable with it and over time your body gets used to that level of pain - so it will take even more to make you uncomfortable.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## First sparring session\\n\\nI still remember my first sparring session, I got hit on the nose and had tears coming out of my eyes from it. My nose hurt for 3 days in a row. It doesn\'t matter how many times the coach told me to keep my hands up, nothing taught me quicker than that cross on my nose.\\n\\nFor the remainder of the fight, I was mostly protecting myself and keeping my distance. I was \\"humbled\\" by the other fighter, and was pushed to outside my comfort zone.\\n\\nThis is not so much different from startup life where mentally you have to be in uncomfortable places - for me this is the equivalent to speaking on a stage. For an introvert like myself, that was something that was hard to overcome. Although I am still not comfortable on a stage, I am much more comfortable than I used to be.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing_3.png\\"/>\\n    <p style={{fontSize: \'0.8em\'}}>Presenting at CIBC a few weeks ago at New York AI meetup</p>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Next sparring sessions\\n\\nCurrently when I step in a ring I have mixed feelings, I\'m somewhat anxious but also excited about it.\\n\\nIt\'s weird.\\n\\nI mean, I know full well that I\'m going against folks who\'ve been in a ring since they were young - and I also know full well that I\'m going to get hit much more than I will hit.\\n\\n**However**, there\'s something exciting (poetic maybe?) about knowing that each time I step into the ring again, I will be able to land more punches, avoid more hits and be better mentally.\\n\\nLearning is the nature of the game.\\n\\nAnd the only failure is to not take any lessons from each fight.\\n\\nThis is the same for startups.

Either releasing AI features to millions of users before proper testing (e.g. Gemini overview on Google and the whole Reddit answers), adding AI where it isn\'t really necessary (e.g. Meta AI on WhatsApp), exploring new monetization opportunities (e.g. Amazon Bedrock for fine-tuning) or risking on their values to not be left behind (e.g. Apple partnering with OpenAI \u2014 risking the security brand they worked so hard for).\\n\\nSo, I think this will happen soon.\\n\\nAnd it\'s with that in mind that we have been building OpenBB.\\n\\n## How can I prepare for the shift?\\n\\nI think that the most important question that financial analysts should ask themselves is not \'**when**\' but \'**what can I do to prepare myself for when AI starts taking over**\'.\\n\\nThere\'s going to be multiple stages before AI fully takes over. Here\'s how I envision it playing out:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-08-06-why-ai-will-replace-jobs-in-finance-and-how-you-should-prepare_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n(For what it\'s worth, I think this is equivalent to what will happen to developers in general).\\n\\n### Short term\\n\\nWe are starting to enter this timeline.\\n\\nA timeline where analysts will use AI to augment their output.\\n\\nA good analyst using AI will be able to perform at a better level than a great analyst who doesn\'t use AI.\\n\\nInterestingly, a mediocre analyst will be able to increase their output but nowhere as much as a good or great analyst. This is because the AI usage will supervised and still \\"driven\\" by the analyst (through prompts). So mediocre analysts will not benefit as much because they will either trust too much the AI (without being able to discern its validity), not use the best prompts because they don\'t know what to use the AI for, or not use the output because they won\'t comprehend the insights that the AI is generating.\\n\\nDuring this period, the gap between mediocre and great analysts will be at an all-time high. This will expose more who is pushing their weight and who isn\'t.\\n\\nAnother thing is that firms that will be hiring high-talented juniors/interns will start adding AI experience as a requirement (e.g. OpenBB experience) since they understand that they will have a higher leverage and their output will be much better. Potentially even replacing a current analyst with many years of experience that doesn\'t leverage AI in the day-to-day.\\n\\nI think there are 2 reasons for this:\\n\\n1. **AI will allow financial analysts to have much broader mandates** as they will be able to automate the process of research and screen the best companies. Instead of analyzing 20 companies per quarter, they will do 500.\\n\\n2. **AI will be able to extract trends and patterns that humans simply can\'t due to the amount of data necessary to process**. The amount of data that financial firms use to invest is constantly on the rise, that\'s where they get their alpha from. Given that an analyst has a limited amount of resources, they will either have to narrow down the companies in their mandate or process less data for each.\\n\\n### Long term\\n\\nIn the long term, AI will start taking the reigns.\\n\\nThis is the equivalent of self-driving cars becoming fully autonomous.\\n\\nThe gap between mediocre and great analysts will narrow over time because AI is doing all the heavy work.\\n\\nAt that time, it will be very hard to distinguish the competency of mediocre and great analysts \u2014 the main indicator will be how they interpret/understand the AI model, i.e. how they can explain what led to the AI \\"deciding\\" to invest in companies based on hundreds of different datasets.\\n\\nThis is why we spend hours obsessing over the UX of the [OpenBB Terminal Pro](https://openbb.co/products/pro). We want to make sure analysts know at all times what the AI Copilot is doing and thinking. Because interpretability will be a big topic in the future.\\n\\nIt\'s important to note that the best analysts will be the ones who have their jobs more secure over time. That is because provided the AI is taking the reigns, when it fully takes the reigns, the output of all analysts will be more or less the same. However, in the period before, the great analyst will have an edge because their skill is still in use and so the leverage lever is bigger.\\n\\nI think that when AI fully takes over analysts\' jobs, the best ones will move towards opening their investment firms and focus on the human part of the job: communication.\\n\\nCommunicating to their investors why they made their decisions, e.g. \\"We have access to this dataset which others don\'t, and our AI model correlated that data with x, y, and z which enabled us to invest ahead of the rest of the market\\". This is the \\"interpretability\\" of the AI that I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n## What can you do?\\n\\nYou should still pursue a career in the space.\\n\\nBut you should do so with AI in mind.\\n\\nExperiment with products out there that leverage AI to make you more efficient (you can try OpenBB for free at pro.openbb.co). You will soon realize that your output can compete with someone who is neglecting AI in their day-to-day.\\n\\nBeing a top financial analyst is still something you should strive for since these are going to be the last to be replaced. And when they are, you will still have an edge because your role is likely to evolve into a communication/management role that explains what the AI is doing to investors. And that would be much easier if you\'re a top analyst in the first place - because you would understand the insights extracted from an AI copilot.\\n\\nWhat is your opinion on this topic?"},{"id":"inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life.md","title":"Inspired by Bia - How her fight against cancer changed my life","description":"In a time when we talk about going to Mars and having AGI, cancer is still taking lives every day.","date":"2024-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"personal-story","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal-story"},{"inline":true,"label":"grief","permalink":"/blog/tags/grief"},{"inline":true,"label":"motivation","permalink":"/blog/tags/motivation"},{"inline":true,"label":"cancer-awareness","permalink":"/blog/tags/cancer-awareness"},{"inline":true,"label":"charity","permalink":"/blog/tags/charity"},{"inline":true,"label":"fundraising","permalink":"/blog/tags/fundraising"},{"inline":true,"label":"life-lessons","permalink":"/blog/tags/life-lessons"},{"inline":true,"label":"resilience","permalink":"/blog/tags/resilience"},{"inline":true,"label":"inspiration","permalink":"/blog/tags/inspiration"}],"readingTime":5.94,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life","title":"Inspired by Bia - How her fight against cancer changed my life","date":"2024-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life.JPG","tags":["personal-story","grief","motivation","cancer-awareness","charity","fundraising","life-lessons","resilience","inspiration"],"description":"In a time when we talk about going to Mars and having AGI, cancer is still taking lives every day."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why AI Will Replace Jobs in Finance and How You Should Prepare","permalink":"/blog/why-ai-will-replace-jobs-in-finance-and-how-you-should-prepare"},"nextItem":{"title":"My first-hand experience on AI impacting education through Perplexity, Cursor and ChatGPT","permalink":"/blog/my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life.JPG\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nIn a time when we talk about going to Mars and having AGI, cancer is still taking lives every day.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nThis cause could not have been a personal one, but it is.\\n\\nAs a young kid from a small town in Portugal, people who die from cancer are on TV and I don\'t know them personally.\\n\xa0\\nMy friends & family are \\"protected\\" by an imaginary shield that I created in my head.\\n\\nUntil they aren\'t.\\n\\nLet me go back down memory lane and talk about Beatriz.\\n\\nBia was in my class in high school.\\n\\nWe started talking here and there.\\n\\nBefore I knew it, she was my best friend.\\n\\nWe would talk for hours about everything and nothing - always laughing.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life.JPG\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nWe would sit next to each other and professors would have a hard time with us because we liked to chit chat.\\n\\nSo we created a new communication medium to not get caught.\\n\\nWe would rip the side of those pages and write in very small font notes to each other.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life_1.jpg\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nWe would go through multiple of these in each class.\\n\\nIt was our thing.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life_2.JPG\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nA few months later, we had a sports class and she felt weak from her wrist.\\n\\nShe didn\'t really like sports.

I gave 4 hours of classes, divided into:\\n\\n- Supervised Learning - Theory\\n- Supervised Learning - Practice\\n\\nAnd then evaluated the students coursework.\\n\\n## Creating a new syllabus\\n\\nMy past experience as a teacher happened during my BSc., back in 2016, where I was a TA for the course of Signal Theory and had to help students in their coursework through Matlab/Octave.\\n\\nThings were different at the time because I had a syllabus to follow and most of my time was spent helping students if they were blocked coding-wise or had some questions regarding the theory.\\n\\nAnd of course - there was no AI. At least not in the sense that we speak about today - i.e. there were no LLMs.\\n\\nThis time was different - I had the flexibility to choose what I was going to cover about Supervised Learning.\\n\\nI\'ve never worked as a Data Scientist per se, but have been passionate about data for a while and spent a lot of time reading books and learning about the topic. In my previous company, I started playing with IMU data in my spare time which lead me to publish a paper at ICMLA where I used [Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Step Detection using Nurvv trackers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9680024) and even open sourced the code [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/step-detection-ML/tree/main).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_svm_paper.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nI\'ve wrote about this and how I managed to write the entire code in my spare time in a single week, and missing the yearly team event in order to pull this off. You can read more about it [here](/blog/how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla).\\n\\nBut so the question is:\\n\\n_\\"Where do I start?\\"_\\n\\nMy first intuition was to gather some of my favorite books and courses on the topic and understand how they presented the overall subject. I wouldn\'t have the same time, so I would need to touch on most topics briefly - enough for students to know about it and explore further if curious.\\n\\nHowever, given my time constraints with running OpenBB, I would have had a hard time since I would need to:\\n\\n1. Consume the content of these books and courses\\n2. Mix and match them\\n3. Cut to fit the time constraints\\n4. Produce a final syllabus that I\'m confident about\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis was not a trivial task, and definitely not a weekend job.\\n\\nExcept that **IT WAS**.\\n\\n### Perplexity enters the chat\\n\\nSince Perplexity\'s main value proposition is being better at Google than Google - I popped the following prompt into it.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_perplexity.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nBAM.\ud83d\udca5\\n\\nThis was exactly what I was looking for.\\n\\nDid it give me the content end-to-end that I was expecting?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nWas it a perfect starting point?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nI didn\'t literally copy-paste it. I took the parts I liked, re-iterated on the ones I didn\'t until I eventually did. Plus, use my experience to prioritize parts that I felt should be more relevant vs others.\\n\\nWere there some hallucinations?\\n\\nYes, it\'s not a silver bullet.\\n\\nBut it saved me DAYS of work.\\n\\nI was dreading having to write the syllabus and like this, it was actually fun. It was fun because I felt like Perplexity was acting as my assistant and I was engaging in a conversation of what should be contained within the course and what shouldn\'t.\\n\\nAfter having all the content ready, I asked my wife to help me with some images to make it easier for students to understand concepts.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_assets.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nI was happy with the results - but wanted a second opinion. So I asked a friend of mine who\'s been a DS for over 6 years what his thoughts were on the materials I worked on - and he was impressed about the speed.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_ai_friend_message.jpeg\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nBeing a fan of open source, I have open sourced all the theory and practice of the course and you can access it here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/supervised-learning\\n\\nFor the practice exercises I made it so that users can run it with colab directly on the browser to focus on the learning and not on the installation of libraries - highly recommend doing this.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_colab.jpeg\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Assessing students grades\\n\\nAfter presenting the classes to the students, they had to work on a final project that involved supervised learning - and I had to grade their work on it. The grade was from 0 to 5 and I was given freedom in terms of what criteria to use.\\n\\nSo I did what someone else in my shoes would do.\\n\\n## ChatGPT to define grading criteria\\n\\nI typed [chat.openai.com](http://chat.openai.com) and had a conversation with ChatGPT about the best way to grade the coursework. I wanted it to be as fair as possible, but also evaluate students based on criteria outside of coding, such as problem formulation and documentation/clarity.\\n\\nNote: Story for another day but with the raise of LLMs, I have a very strong opinion that documentation and clarity will be as important as the code itself.\\n\\nThis is the outcome of that conversation:\\n\\n> **PART I - Problem Formulation**\\n> - 1.a. **Clarity and Definition:** Is the problem clearly defined and well-formulated? Are the project\'s objectives explicitly mentioned?\\n>\\n> - 1.b. **Relevance and Context:** Is the relevance of the problem within the application domain explained? Does the problem justify the use of supervised learning?\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n> **PART II - Documentation and Quality**\\n> - **2.a. Code Quality and Readability:** Clarity and Structure: Is the code well-organized with clear and consistent formatting? Are comments used effectively to explain complex logic? Best Practices: Does the code follow standard coding practices (e.g., naming conventions, modularization)? Are functions and classes used appropriately?\\n>\\n> - **2.b. Documentation and Explanation in Comments or Notebook Markdown**: Clarity: Are the results and methodology clearly documented? Is there a detailed explanation of the steps taken and the reasons behind them? Visualization: Are visual aids (e.g., graphs, plots) used to illustrate key points and results? Are these visualizations clear and informative?\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n> **PART III - Code**\\n>\\n> - **3.a. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Completeness: Are all necessary steps for data preprocessing included (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features)? Justification: Are the preprocessing steps justified and explained? Is there a clear reason for the choices made?\\n>\\n> - **3.b. Data Exploration**: Initial Analysis: Is there an exploratory data analysis? Are descriptive statistics used to better understand the data? Visualization: Are visualizations (e.g., graphs, plots) used to illustrate data distribution, correlations, and important patterns? Are these visualizations clear and informative?\\n>\\n> - **3.c. Model Implementation and Training**: Correctness: Is the model implemented correctly according to the chosen algorithm? Are appropriate libraries and functions used? Parameter Tuning: Is there evidence of parameter tuning or optimization? Are the chosen parameters explained and justified?\\n>\\n> - **3.d. Evaluation and Validation**: Metrics: Are appropriate evaluation metrics chosen and calculated? Are these metrics relevant to the problem at hand? Validation Techniques: Are appropriate validation techniques used (e.g., cross-validation, train-test split)? Is there an analysis of the model\'s performance on both training and testing data?\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis was it.\\n\\nExactly what I was looking for.\\n\\nNow I could grade a student on each of these criteria, then select a final grade weight for each criteria (e.g. 5-15%), create a spreadsheet with such a table and call it a day.\\n\\nHowever, the most time-consuming task was coming - the grading itself.\\n\\nThere were 10 groups in total. So 10 notebooks that I had to look into, exploring completely different datasets with a different ML model being used, different ways to do exploratory data analysis, different ways to assess the model, different objectives, \u2026\\n\\n### Cursor helping with grading\\n\\nI opened [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) (which is basically VSCode + ChatGPT) and probably the software I\'ve recommended the most to developers in 2024.\\n\\nAnd opened my first notebook.\\n\\nThen I thought, what if I had GPT-4o on my side - helping me to assess this coursework.\\n\\nIt didn\'t need to be perfect because I was doing it myself, but it could help me understand if there was any critical thing that I missed OR if it completely had a different grade than the one I was going to provide - which would enable me to spend more time on that criteria and iterate.\\n\\nIt gave me confidence that I was being fair to the students.\\n\\nAnd made me realize how hard it is for professors when they have 100s of students and have a subjective answer to grade. It\'s impossible to get it right. They try their best, but as soon as the answer is not binary (0 or 1), they are doomed to fail.\\n\\nSo how did I do it?\\n\\nGiven that I just wanted GPT-4o to quickly review each of the criterias based on the code, I created a prompt that I could use for all of notebooks that the students sent.\\n\\nThis is what my setup looked like\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"1000\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_cursor.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nHaving the code on the left side and the copilot on the right side that I could use to chat really enabled me to grade more confidently.\\n\\nHere\'s an example of a section of a response I got to one of the student\'s notebooks\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_cursor_output.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nOne thing I did to have the copilot produce better outputs was to push it to do chain-of-thought (CoT). Meaning that I prompted the model to explain the reasoning behind a decision before providing a grade. This has been proved to yield to less hallucinations and more accurate responses - which is what I was looking for.\\n\\n**What if I wanted to do this at scale?**\\n\\nI would have put more effort into the prompt and focused on evaluating 1 criteria at a time. I would have done few-shot prompting where I put examples of what grades 1,2,3,4,5 look like for such criteria so the model has those references and can check for similarity of issues committed or successful tasks performed.\\n\\nNote: the model was able to interpret comments written in Portuguese which is another benefit.\\n\\n## Democratizing access to tutors\\n\\nWhile I was working on my prompts to get some feedback from AI in terms of student\'s coursework I realized that I only need $20/mo to access them.\\n\\nBut then I realized - so do the students.\\n\\nThis means that the students have no reason to NOT run their entire coursework by a LLM that can act as a critic of their work.\\n\\nThey can keep iterating until the model doesn\'t find anything - hence making students feel more confident about the work they are putting forward.\\n\\nMy initial thought was: \\"this feels like cheating\\" (right after the - \\"I wish I had this a few years ago\\").\\n\\nBut it actually isn\'t.\\n\\nTutors have existed for a long time.\\n\\nStudents pay tutors to spend time with them to learn outside of classes - whether it\'s explaining the theory or helping with coursework.\\n\\nHowever, tutors are a vitamin and not a painkiller (they are a nice-to-have and not a must-have). And because they aren\'t a requirement, it\'s not a typical choice among lower-income families.\\n\\nOn the other hand, kids from wealthy families often have multiple tutors. Not for students who are almost failing their class, but who want to bump their grades from A- to an A+.\\n\\nBut this is about to change.\\n\\nFor the most part, GPT-3.5 is accessible for free.\\n\\nThis means that everyone can have access to a tutor that they can work with to have better grades but also produce better coursework.\\n\\nThis means that the concept of a tutor will be democratized and the playing field between students who come from different wealth backgrounds will be leveled and fair.\\n\\n## A final thought on open source\\n\\nAnother class that I had to give to students was \\"Data Analytics in Financial Markets\\".\\n\\nThe goal here was to have a more real-life application of data analytics, particularly in financial markets - and even feature OpenBB which has partnered with this university.\\n\\nBut when I started working on the content from scratch, I wondered.\\n\\nCan\'t I find a repository on GitHub that suits my needs?\\n\\nAnd I did.\\n\\nThe GitHub repository I found was the GitHub repository that contains the code for the case studies in the O\'Reilly book \\"Machine Learning and Data Science Blueprints for Finance\\" written by my friend [Hariom Tatsat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hariomtatsat/): https://github.com/tatsath/fin-ml.\\n\\nSo why would I spend the time re-inventing the wheel when I could just walk students through a few of these case studies?\\n\\nThis is what I did.\\n\\nWhich then made me think that all of this data has been already fed into foundational models, and so even if I were to apply the same approach I did earlier with Perplexity or ChatGPT - it is likely that with a good prompt some of the main examples would have been derived from this repository.\\n\\nBut in this case, this repository already had the perfect case-study format I was looking for, and so I can more easily credit the author.\\n\\nwhich made me wonder:\\n\\n_How will open source authors be able to get credit for their work when all of it is being translated into weights in a big neural network architecture?_"},{"id":"why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future.md","title":"Why chat-only AI financial assistants are not the future","description":"Financial assistants structured like ChatGPT are great for quick searches but fall short for comprehensive investment research.","date":"2024-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"fintech","permalink":"/blog/tags/fintech"},{"inline":true,"label":"workspaces","permalink":"/blog/tags/workspaces"},{"inline":true,"label":"investment-research","permalink":"/blog/tags/investment-research"},{"inline":true,"label":"chatbots","permalink":"/blog/tags/chatbots"},{"inline":true,"label":"ui","permalink":"/blog/tags/ui"},{"inline":true,"label":"ux","permalink":"/blog/tags/ux"},{"inline":true,"label":"collaboration","permalink":"/blog/tags/collaboration"}],"readingTime":5.86,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future","title":"Why chat-only AI financial assistants are not the future","date":"2024-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future.png","tags":["openbb","ai","fintech","workspaces","investment-research","chatbots","ui","ux","collaboration"],"description":"Financial assistants structured like ChatGPT are great for quick searches but fall short for comprehensive investment research."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"My first-hand experience on AI impacting education through Perplexity, Cursor and ChatGPT","permalink":"/blog/my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt"},"nextItem":{"title":"29 years old and sitting on the top of giants","permalink":"/blog/29-years-old-and-sitting-on-the-top-of-giants"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nFinancial assistants structured like ChatGPT are great for quick searches but fall short for comprehensive investment research. They are limited by their one-dimensional approach, which hinders efficient data retrieval and long-term usability. Read on to discover how OpenBB Terminal Pro addresses these issues with a three-dimensional solution.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nThis is a spicy take but bear with me.\\n\\nThe more I think about \\"ChatGPT for Finance\\" products, the more I think this is not the answer.\\n\\nThey are extremely good knowledge retrieval engines because you can ask what you want to know and get the answer immediately.\\n\\nMy problem with their approach is what happens after.\\n\\nHowever, very little thought is given to the real-world investment workflow. That\'s why I strongly believe that a chat-only financial platform will never be successful on its own.\\n\\nSure, they can win in the categories of \\"search\\" or \\"screening\\", but they won\'t be able to compete in the category of \\"investment research platform\\".\\n\\nTo do that, they would need to evolve.\\n\\nLet me explain why and how OpenBB differs from them.\\n\\n## 1-Dimensional vs N-Dimensional\\n\\nFinancial assistants are, in general, 1-dimensional. By that, I mean that all you have on a screen is a \\"dashboard\\" with an unlimited y-axis (1 single dimension).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis means that whatever information they output will always be in the same position, which is great for the short term.\\n\\nBut for the long term? Not so much. If the user wants to find specific information, they will need to keep scrolling up the text to find it.\\n\\nWhen financial assistants allow multiple conversations, then we start having 2 dimensions, where each conversation introduces a new axis.\\n\\nThe problem with this approach is that you can\'t easily find data within one of those past conversations since the assistant focuses on answering your question and not on data retrieval from the previous outputs.\\n\\n## Our 3-dimensional solution on Terminal Pro\\n\\nHow do we handle those issues? We have 3 dimensions.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nOur Terminal Pro has a Copilot on the side, similar to other financial assistants.\\n\\nHowever, its big advantage is that when you want to save Copilot\'s output for later, you can convert it into a text widget. And when you do so, you can place it wherever you want in this space \u2014 with the axis being infinite vertical scroll, tabs, dashboards, and folders.\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/ebdda68a-95f7-425b-aebe-5c98936c9189\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\n## Storage-based solutions are not optimized for investment research\\n\\nAgain, financial assistants are optimized for search rather than information storage.\\n\\nThis means that, by nature, chat-only financial assistants assume that their output will not matter in the future, so they answer your queries similarly to how a text conversation works. It\'s literally called ChatGPT for that reason.\\n\\nHowever, that\'s not ideal for investment research.\\n\\nIf analysts and researchers need to access these financial assistants\' output at some point in the future, they won\'t be able to do it quickly. Instead, they\'ll have to go through a long chat history.\\n\\nThis is why, in our Terminal Pro, we allow users to create a markdown-based text widget from the Copilot\'s output, as shown above, so that you can have that information quickly accessible, but also editable.\\n\\n## There\'s no simple way to know where the data comes from\\n\\nFinancial assistants are great, and they are improving every day. But if there\'s something I\'ve learned from talking with financial firms for over three years, it\'s that this is a very slow-moving industry, and adopting new technologies takes time.\\n\\nBut with AI, it seems different. It\'s so revolutionary that people are willing to incorporate it into their workflow faster because they immediately understand the benefits it can bring to their business.\\n\\nHowever, hallucinations are still a big problem \u2014 so it\'s essential for these firms to be able to verify the raw data and sources.\\n\\nThe current level of AI is equivalent to having a smart intern that you would need to double-check their work or trust but verify.\\n\\nThis is why our Copilot always answers based on data that is readily available on the dashboard \u2014 and (due to our \\"Bring Your Own Data\\" technology) that data can be brought by your firm rather than being limited to what we offer out of the box.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Financial chats are not collaborative\\n\\nFinancial assistants are not collaborative by default.\\n\\nWhen someone opens a tool like ChatGPT, they are interested in getting an answer to their question. Can you imagine what would happen if more people had access to that conversation and asked ChatGPT a different question? That would translate into a horrible user experience.\\n\\nThe interesting thing is that investment research starts as an individual process but ends up being a collaborative effort where the findings are shared and discussed within a team.\\n\\nSo, financial assistants have a challenging task: multiple people on a team should be able to access all the conversations without being able to interact with these chats.\\n\\nBut what if you go through a colleague\'s chat where they were asking questions about a company\'s earnings, and you want to do a follow-up question?\\n\\nThat\'s a complex problem.\\n\\nAt OpenBB, we are in a very good position to solve this for our users.\\n\\nSince we allow them to create a widget from their conversation with the Copilot, users can effectively create the ideal dashboard to share with their team. On their turn, other team members will then be able to use the Copilot on that same dashboard to make their questions.\\n\\nAnd guess what?\\n\\nThis can be considered yet another dimension that we allow users to explore.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future_4.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Wrap up\\n\\nIn a nutshell,\\n\\n- Most AI financial assistant products are 1-dimensional. Great at retrieving an answer quickly but poor at the overall task of doing investment research.\\n\\n- OpenBB Terminal Pro is positioning itself as a flexible and customizable investment research platform with N-dimensions that an AI copilot can control to produce a full investment dashboard as if it were an analyst.\\n\\nI\'m biased, but once we provide the OpenBB Copilot with the capability to interact with the interface (create widgets, dashboards and folders) we might be the company that gets closest to replace an analyst\'s job."},{"id":"29-years-old-and-sitting-on-the-top-of-giants","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/29-years-old-and-sitting-on-the-top-of-giants","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-06-05-29-years-old-and-sitting-on-the-top-of-giants.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-05-29-years-old-and-sitting-on-the-top-of-giants.md","title":"29 years old and sitting on the top of giants","description":"Yesterday was my 29th birthday, and I was reflecting on my life and on how sitting on the top of giants isn\u2019t given enough credit.

He did his homework during that time since there was no electricity back then.\\n\\nIf a sheep ran away while he was doing his homework, his dad would punish him with whatever was at hand, a stick or a belt.\\n\\nTimes were different back then.\\n\\nIn school, if he got questions like 7x8 wrong, teachers wouldn\u2019t just say the correct answer. They had a special ruler that was used to hit a student\u2019s hand.\\n\\nAgain, times were different.\\n\\nAfter a couple of years in school - he didn\u2019t like it (I wonder why eh) and they didn\u2019t have a lot of money. So he started working at the age of 11 in construction.\\n\\nAn 11 year old kid, taking 2 buckets of cement up and down the stairs to build houses.\\n\\nAt the age of 17 he moved to Geneva (Switzerland) for a better paid job, as a bricklayer but also did painting jobs and similar.\\n\\nAt 18, his mum died.  She was run over by a car near our hometown.\\n\\nAt 20, he had to come to Portugal because of his passport and he met my mum.\\n\\n1 year later, my mum moved to Geneva to be with him. She worked in a factory making boxes for Rolex watches.\\n\\nAt 22, his dad died from a disease.\\n\\nHe kept working his ass off. 6 days a week, starting at 6 am whether it was snowing, raining or extremely hot.\\n\\nNo travelling or unnecessary expenses, except tobacco, it was his only addiction as everyone around him smoked - it was a social thing.\\n\\nAt 24 he got married with my mum. My mum\u2019s family didn\u2019t like his, so they didn\u2019t attend the wedding and they had to cover it with all of their savings.\\n\\nAt 31, he had me.\\n\\nThe week before I was born would be the last he would ever smoke, since my mum said that she didn\u2019t want smoke near us because of our health. At some point he was smoking 2 packs a day, and he stopped from one day to the other which is wild.\\n\\nAt 32 his painting shift had just finished and his boss asked him to give one more painting layer to the outside of an apartment. And he went up the ladder, and it broke. He fell from a 2-story apartment on his foot, and his foot bone got smashed into pieces. (He had actually mentioned to his boss that the ladder didn\u2019t feel very stable earlier that day).\\n\\u2028The doctor told him that he would never be able to do any physical work ever again. 24 years later, and he still struggles to walk for long periods of time.\\n\\nAt 33, he had my brother.\\n\\nBecause of the accident, he stayed at home to raise my brother and I.\\n\\nA bit after, Portugal joined the Euro. So my dad thought that the living conditions in Portugal would improve overall like other European countries (spoiler alert: it didn\u2019t).\\n\\nSo, he decided to start building a house on the same land where his hometown house was, in Portugal.\\n\\nThey couldn\u2019t afford to buy a house in Geneva, but had enough savings that they could build one in his hometown.\\n\\nThey went back when he was 39 (I was 8), and that\u2019s where I grew up.\\n\\nMy mum struggled to find a job for many years - she only got a job as a secretary at a furniture store - until they went bankrupt.\\n\\nMy dad had depression since he was stuck at home with nothing to do.\\n\\nGrowing up, I wanted to work as a bricklayer in summers to make some cash and my dad forbid me doing so.\\n\\nHe said that it was dangerous and he didn\u2019t want me to have that life. He has seen a lot of young people dropping out of school because they start receiving salaries early and prioritise short-term outcomes over long-term ones.\\n\\nHe didn\u2019t want me to follow that path.\\n\\nHe wanted to give me the opportunities that he didn\u2019t have growing up. And he did.\\n\\nOne day I got home from high school, and commented that someone I knew always had expensive clothes and watches. He happened to know their family and got upset. He was upset because he knew that they owed a lot of money to a lot of people - and kept living a luxury lifestyle.\\n\\u2028So he told me \u201cYou may not wear all of that, but you will never hear in your life that we owe anything to anyone. Everything you have has been bought with a lot of hard work from your mother and I, and not by stealing or owing anything to anyone\u201d.\\n\\nI still think about this often, and how appearances are often just that. \\n\\nA few years later after I got into university, my parents decided to move back to Switzerland.\\n\\nMy mum still didn\u2019t have a job and we weren\u2019t going home as much (we both studied relatively far from our hometown). It was hard on her to move away from us, but it was the right thing to do.\\n\\nShe found a job as a cleaner, which she has been doing for almost 10 years now.\\n\\nIn the meantime my dad wondered if he could leverage all the skills he had learned growing up to manage a housing project. So he bought land in Portugal, and was heavily involved in the management of the project. Meaning he worked across everything, except the physical aspects of the job.\\n\\nIt was an investment, but after having so many years in real estate - it was hard for someone to have as much knowledge breadth as he did in terms of costs of materials and staff since he had been on the other side of the coin for a long time. \\n\\nNow he does that every now and then, which keeps him busy. But since it involves being far from my mum, this time he\u2019s hiring an agency to be more involved at the expense of less headaches and a lower margin.\\n\\nHe has a good life now. But he came from nothing, literally.\\n\\nMost people on his shoes, don\u2019t make it.\\n\\nDamn.\\n\\nMost people with more opportunities than him don\u2019t make it.\\n\\nI often feel guilty because I get to live life in a way that my parents could never.\\n\\nThe best way I can think to repay them is to work hard and show them that their hard life will be the last that the future Lopes generation will have to endure.\\n\\nThat and hopefully buying them a nice car one day."},{"id":"rabbit-r1-there-is-hope","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/rabbit-r1-there-is-hope","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope.md","title":"rabbit r1, there is hope","description":"I can see a future where people use rabbit r1 for very particular use cases where phone is suboptimal.

I ordered this one because it\'s [open source](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) and I can build on top.\\n\\nWhile at the surface these devices are somewhat similar, they approach the problem from a different angle. AI pin relies on users to clip their device to their clothes, the pendant is put on the collar of your top and 01 is held handheld. Rabbit r1 is also handheld, but unlike the others contains a screen to interact with - so it\'s closer to a phone than the others.\\n\\nNonetheless, according to Jesse (rabbit\'s CEO) they are currently the most successful AI device in terms of sales (sold over 100,000 rabbit r1 in a few weeks).\\n\\n## How I got my r1\\n\\nMy wife saw me watching a few videos of rabbit r1 and decided to surprise me with one, a one-time $199 purchase without any subscription fee. I wonder why she didn\u2019t do it when I was watching Apple Vision Pro \ud83d\ude04.\\n\\nBut they didn\u2019t ship immediately. My batch was only meant to be shipped sometime in June. However, rabbit tweeted that there would be a Pickup Party in NYC. I added notifications on their X account and once they announced that registrations were open I was ready. I RSVPd and this week I attended the event to grab mine.\\n\\nThe event was well organized. One thing is for sure, rabbit knows how to build a community and hype with their users.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThe keynote presented at the event can be found [here](https://www.rabbit.tech/live-unboxing). In it, rabbit\'s CEO unboxes a rabbit r1 and shows everything it can do on stage.\\n\\n## My experience\\n\\nI have been playing with rabbit r1 for a couple of days now. A few funny things I\'ve done since:\\n\\n- Jailbreak rabbit r1 to say [f*ck which falls outside the guidelines](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1783335809459859708)\\n\\n- Ask it what LLM it was using under the hood, to which it said [it was using a fine-tuned version of OpenAI\'s GPT-3](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1783346493832753477)\\n\\n- Have rabbit r1 make a [Deez Nuts joke](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1784228313717776505)\\n\\n- Use rabbit r1 as a [Not Hotdog app](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1784357946920505387) ([Silicon Valley reference](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/))\\n\\nBut now onto the serious stuff. Since I was at the Pickup Party where Jesse split the presentation based on the major features of the products, I want to address each of these individually after having time to play with them.\\n\\n### Search\\n\\nFor search, rabbit r1 relies on [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/). I\'m a Perplexity fan myself and at some point I even replaced my default [Arc browser](https://arc.net/) search engine with Perplexity. This only lasted one day because then I realized how many times I just wanted to end up on a landing page or on someone\'s LinkedIn/X. It made me realize why Google is, well, Google. Regardless, this is something that I do with my phone, and so I don\'t think it\'s a strong use case.\\n\\nHowever, if you have a kid that is curious to understand the world. I think a rabbit r1 is well worth it to use it to ask questions that they are curious about, without having the distractions that a phone provides.\\n\\n### Vision\\n\\n**What is this** - I just don\'t think this is a strong use case overall. This is not something that you do daily, weekly, or even monthly. Maybe once a year or so. The last time I did it was last year in Mexico to know the name of an animal that was nearby. I went to Google and looked for \\"Mexico animal that looks like a racoon\\" and the first answer was Coati which was what I was looking for. If that query didn\'t work, I would have taken a picture of the animal and then Google search - but that\'s my second choice because of the effort of doing so. This to say that it\'s not really a pain point that users will have.\\n\\n**Edit spreadsheet** - This is a somewhat interesting use case choice, I wonder if they picked it up because no other device showed being capable of doing this (taking a picture to a handwritten table, asking for a change and emailing the image to your email). Personally, I don\'t write tables that much anymore on paper, and the ones I do are small enough that if I want to transcribe it takes me seconds to do. It may be a strong use case for certain jobs, but I\u2019m not sure about it, nor the performance it would have on large tables. The example Jesse shared at the event was a 5x3 tabl.\\n\\n### Terminal mode\\n\\nIt\u2019s like using ChatGPT but with a worse interface. The keyboard reminds me of BlackBerry but it\u2019s gimmicky to use - personally, I didn\u2019t like the experience. I would always pick up my phone to use ChatGPT over using the Terminal mode for instance.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Translation\\n\\nYES. Having Portuguese parents that don\u2019t speak english, whenever they are with my wife, I need to be the translator. So having a device that allows them to translate in \u201creal-time\u201d both ways is a huge value add.\\n\\nYes, I know that Google already has this feature - but it\'s shit and if you disagree, you never actually used it. LLMs can understand expression and meaning, in a way that a model like BERT cannot. I actually did this post where I prompted ChatGPT to do exactly this - act as a device that stays in the middle of a conversation translating from one language to another based on who the speaker was (tweet [here](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1740049615804846461), it went kind of viral).\\n\\nSure, this could be an app, but I quite like the idea of having a device that just does this. I think that\u2019s because the translation works both ways, so I imagine you passing the device to the other person to press the button when they want to speak. So that way, it feels more like a \u201ccommon\u201d object whereas your phone is more personal.\\n\\nAlthough I was excited about this, and it was the first thing I tried it failed badly. The CTO of the company [replied](https://x.com/LiaoPeiyuan/status/1783001793573843078) to [my tweet](https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1783000272278569412) saying that they are working on fixing it.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_4.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n### Notes\\n\\nYay, another note-taking app. NOT. I\u2019d prefer an integration with the Apple Notes app or Notion, so I don\u2019t need to then go into yet another website and copy-paste those notes to some other place.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_5.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Voice Recording\\n\\nThe voice recording feature is pretty good. If you are a content creator (e.g., writer, youtuber), I think this is very powerful. The way I see it is that rabbit offers way less distractions than your phone, so you could go on a walk and take r1 and just speak with it to brainstorm ideas. Then go to the website and analyze your ideas to transform it into content.\\n\\nPersonally, when I have ideas like this I just drop a voice note to my wife\u2019s WhatsApp and then mark the message as unread. It\u2019s hacky but it works and I\'ve been doing it for a long time now. We have an inside joke where I start these audios with \u201cNote to self\u201d and she always makes fun of it.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex justify-center gap-2\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_6.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" /> \\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_7.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n### Music\\n\\nLast year for my birthday my wife gave me a [Divoom Ditoo-Pro Retro](https://divoom.com/products/divoom-pro) - it does a lot of things (e.g. music, radio, alarm, voice memo, games, music, planner, pixel art). Honestly, I just use it for music. It lived in my car during the entire year as a speaker since I didn\'t have bluetooth audio in the car. I think the advantage of rabbit r1 over it is that I can use my voice to change the music, which is handy if you are driving. On the other hand, my Divoom allows me to listen to my audibles since it acts as a bluetooth speaker whereas rabbit r1 would need an audible integration.\\n\\nI think this can be a compelling use case as sitting in the middle of the table at a dinner or party with friends, where if someone wants to change the music they can just use the rabbit r1 to ask for something - and this way you can keep your phone/laptop on you instead of using it for everybody else to touch.\\n\\n### Apps\\n\\n**Doordash/Uber** - I haven\u2019t tried it yet, but I feel like the phone is so good at it already and with a rich UI/UX, that I don\u2019t see the point in using rabbit r1.\\n\\n**Generative AI** - This is an interesting use case. Personally I don\u2019t use Midjourney so I\'m not the target audience. I do find it interesting that you can generate these images on the go on r1 directly without having to go through Discord (suboptimal) experience. I\'m excited about the opportunities that this presents - for instance, integrating with [OpenBB Bot](https://openbb.co/products/bot) to display financial data on rabbit r1 directly.\\n\\n### Teach mode\\n\\nJesse showed a brief preview of how teach mode works but mentioned that this feature is not yet available and they want to nail the user experience and add guardrails so users cannot use it for something malicious. I\'m very excited about the teach mode prospect, since I think this falls in the category of \\"app creation\\" and allows users to use the device for very specific needs, hence opening the total addressable market.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nFirst of all, the rabbit r1 is beautiful. It\'s light, well made and has this bright appealing color. This isn\'t surprising since it was done in collaboration with [Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/) (a company known for making products that I want without knowing what they do).\\n\\nThis may be controversial, but the thing I like the least about the hardware is the button being located on the right side. The reason why I hate that decision is that I cannot easily use the device with one hand only. If I try, it becomes very gimmicky where I do gymnastics just to press the button. I don\'t get why they didn\'t make it right under the scrolling wheel, it would resemble more a controller/phone which is something that our hands have long been accustomed to. Even if the button was located on the upper side of the device, the UX would be MUCH better. \\n\\nThat\'s one of my biggest complaints against the hardware itself, see image below to see what I mean. I almost need to bend my right thumb in order to reach the button which is used very often. One can argue that I can wrap my hands more around the device to give a better experiencing in clicking the button which is 100% true, HOWEVER, if I do that then I can\'t reach the wheel to scroll.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex justify-center gap-2\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_8.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" /> \\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_9.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nAlso, related with the picture from the above. The battery is pretty weak, it needs to be charged often.\\n\\nThe rabbit r1 OS has a lot of room for improvement, a few things I\'ve experienced:\\n- Having a black screen that doesn\'t recover until I manually power off device;\\n- Not triggering the function I want - sometimes it looks for a specific wording, e.g. \\"start a recording session\\" works but \\"do a voice recording\\" does not. I would have expected for it to be able to understand intent;\\n- Sometimes I get a \\"The app is under maintenance. Please try again later\\" for functions that I know it is capable of doing;\\n- Every few minutes getting \\"unable to connect to Rabbit OS\\";\\n- Randomly losing the previous context - I assume this is because of the number of tokens that can fit in the context?;\\n- Spotify integration broken;\\n- Even though it knows my location (due to getting weather app location correct), the time is not correct and I can\'t update it through the settings.\\n\\nBut this is also the first product version and LLMs are by nature non-deterministic so these type of bugs are kind of expected.\\n\\nIt\'s a one-time $199 price tag. There\'s no recurring subscription. As a consumer, I like this a lot. A one-time purchase allows users to buy the product to experiment without any strong commitment (apart from that one-time fee of course). In terms of economics, I\'m not sure how Rabbit will handle a growing user base and better LLMs. During the event, they mentioned a partnership with both OpenAI and Anthropic. If they are using one of these models, someone needs to be paying for these tokens. For instance, for [OpenBB Terminal Pro](https://openbb.co/products/pro) we decided to allow usage similarly to how the ChatGPT free tier works, which basically rate limits based on usage and allows us to keep our costs controlled.\\n\\nMeta is attempting to commoditize LLMs, so if I were in rabbit\'s shoes I would consider hosting [Llama 3](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/) locally and providing inference from this directly. Maybe even do a partnership with [Groq](https://groq.com/) for users paying a small subscription - not so much because of the impressive 800 tokens/s inference (using Llama 3) since rabbit r1 uses voice and inference speed is less relevant, but for the cold start (i.e. the lag between user question and output). Meta\'s commercial license only applies to companies with over 700 Million active users, so I think Rabbit would be good for some time.\\n\\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t recommend rabbit r1 as a phone alternative. Not even close. If someone says that they stopped using their phone after having their rabbit r1, I can guarantee you that they weren\u2019t using their phone a lot anyway. I agree a lot with MKBHD in saying [Phones are OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA).\\n\\nBut if you are reading this, you are probably wondering what are the use cases where I would recommend Rabbit r1. So let\'s do that.\\n\\n### This is a buy if\\n\\n- For kids that are curious and want to learn more about the world. Being able to have it before a phone, is very compelling. Imagine your kid being able to ask r1 what a word means and how to use it in a sentence, who person X is, how something works, to practice learning another language, as a complement when reading a book/studying. The advantage over the phone is that it doesn\'t have any other distractions. It would basically be Perplexity on the go, and thus the Perplexity tagline \\"Where knowledge begins\\" makes total sense.\\n\\n- As a device for two-way translation. The two-way is important, because if it\u2019s just one-way then using the phone is preferred. But being two-way allows for both people to interact with the device, which in my opinion is less personal than a phone and more like a gadget. We aren\'t there yet, but I\'m sure the model will keep improving and becoming better at this.\\n\\n- For content creators who want to \u201czone out\u201d and leave their phone at home and just use the record feature to record content, whether that is a blog post, a new lyrics or a podcast idea. \\n\\n- As a music device to be at the center of a table at a dinner, in the corner at a party selecting the tunes or on a roadtrip. People will enjoy interacting with it due to its unique nature, and that way you don\'t need to be blocked from using your phone.\\n\\n- As a virtual assistant. If the alarm feature was already implemented, I would\'ve likely already replace my Alexa, since rabbit r1 looks much nicer. Even more with the cool standing case.\\n\\n... and of course, the use case is worth $200 for you. There are likely devices that can achieve the same for a cheaper cost. I like the fact that is state-of-the-art and they are trying to innovate.\\n\\nAlso, the rabbit effect going up and down waiting to be prompted and the hears going up when listening is pretty sweet - see it [here](/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_10.png).\\n\\nIn any case, there are two recurring topics in these use cases, so let\'s talk about each individually.\\n\\n### Main use cases\\n\\n1. **A very targeted use case** - The phone can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it\'s your door to the world and what\'s happening. On the other hand, it\'s your door to the world and what\'s happening. I say it this way because this can be extremely good or bad depending on the use case. Phones are optimized for users to spend time on them, apps are optimized to provide dopamine hits so users use them for longer. Notifications will interrupt you throughout the day so you remember to go back to the app, etc.. But sometimes you only want to do 1 thing, and don\'t want to be distracted from it. The best example are E-Books. You can read on your phone, iPad or laptop - yet people decide to buy a kindle so they can just do that. Read with no distractions. You are paying a premium for a product to remove the distractions. I believe that rabbit r1 can achieve this, particularly if they allow developers to build specific apps for specific use cases.\\n\\n2. **Gadget to be used by multiple people** (examples above: two-way translation or music device) - The phone has become a very personal device over the years. If someone gets access to your phone unlocked they have access to who you are (important emails, personal photos, chat conversations, the apps you use and how do you spend your time, the songs you listen or books you read, even confidential documents). So, there are certain scenarios where you don\'t want to borrow your phone to someone to do something, since that requires trust that they won\'t see anything that is confidential. I think Rabbit r1 can go after this category because its a shiny gadget that doesn\'t really hold any personal information from the user, and this way allows the user to keep their phone in their pocket while using rabbit r1 for some tasks that the phone could also do but would require for others to have access to it.\\n\\n<br />\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_11.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Excited about\\n\\n### Developer Ecosystem\\n\\nApple became Apple not because of their revolutionary LCD screen without a keyboard, but because of the developer ecosystem they created. The iPhone became stickier over time, because there were more apps being built on top of it that users could easily tap into. It also allowed Apple to generate revenue from the monetization of these apps.\\n\\nI truly hope that this is the direction that Jesse and team want to take. If I were in their shoes, I would prioritize that over any other feature. Just allow developers to create apps (in this case functions) that the LAM can call to do something very specific.\\n\\nInstead of having their team working on all these features, create the foundational marketplace that allows developers to do so. Start by only allowing free apps and see what developers are building and what users are utilizing. Then move to allow developers to monetize and take a cut from it. And allow users to decide what apps are enabled within their devices and which ones aren\'t - show which apps are the most downloaded and used and link it to a user profile. Make it so that the user profile needs to be a rabbit r1 holder to avoid scams..\\n\\nA few examples: Someone building a Pokedex app for animals, you take r1 to the zoo and just take a picture of the animals with it, then you go home and look into your pokedex. Or a Pokedex for travel monuments. Or integrating OpenBB so I could do research on-the-go.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_12.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n### Native AI-phone\\n\\n[Nothing](https://us.nothing.tech/) has one of the best consumer tech brands out there. If the Apple ecosystem wasn\'t as sticky as it is today, I would buy one. Both Nothing and Rabbit are very unique brands, and I think a partnership between them could be a game-changer.\\n\\nI\'m imagining a Native AI-phone built on Android with rabbit\'s LAM. So, in simple terms, it would be like Nothing Phone (2) but it would have an r1 button that you can use to interact with it through voice instead of fingers. The challenge would be combining the LAM from rabbit r1 to all the apps that Nothing Phone (2) provides - but I believe in a future where applications will be built not only thinking about how humans will utilize them but also LLMs - at least [we are doing that at OpenBB](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-agents) with the [OpenBB Platform](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal)."},{"id":"goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack.md","title":"Goh Analyst - The AI-powered financial analyst who lives on Slack","description":"How I built a financial analyst that lives on Slack and has access to OpenBB.","date":"2024-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/learning"},{"inline":true,"label":"experience","permalink":"/blog/tags/experience"},{"inline":true,"label":"growth","permalink":"/blog/tags/growth"},{"inline":true,"label":"moving","permalink":"/blog/tags/moving"},{"inline":true,"label":"london","permalink":"/blog/tags/london"},{"inline":true,"label":"bay","permalink":"/blog/tags/bay"},{"inline":true,"label":"us","permalink":"/blog/tags/us"},{"inline":true,"label":"travel","permalink":"/blog/tags/travel"},{"inline":true,"label":"startup","permalink":"/blog/tags/startup"},{"inline":true,"label":"nyc","permalink":"/blog/tags/nyc"}],"readingTime":4.01,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack","title":"Goh Analyst - The AI-powered financial analyst who lives on Slack","date":"2024-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack.png","tags":["learning","experience","growth","moving","london","bay","us","travel","startup","nyc"],"description":"How I built a financial analyst that lives on Slack and has access to OpenBB."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"rabbit r1, there is hope","permalink":"/blog/rabbit-r1-there-is-hope"},"nextItem":{"title":"Moving countries and starting a company ain\'t so different","permalink":"/blog/moving-countries-and-starting-a-company-aint-so-different"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nHow I built a financial analyst that lives on Slack and has access to OpenBB.\\n\\nThe open source code is available [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-slack-agent).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nAt OpenBB, we have the tradition of hosting an internal Creaton on the penultimate week of the year.\\n\\nThe OpenBB Creaton is our creative Hackathon, where every team member picks a project to work on throughout the week and gets fully focused on it. The only rule is that it relies on OpenBB technology.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a way for us to get further contact with our technology, but it also allows us to create proofs-of-concept of products/features that we may invest in the feature. Think of it as an R&D week.\\n\\nWe do it then because our team members get the last week of the year as time off. So, if they want to present their project to the rest of the team in January, they can also use that time to wrap up.\\n\\n## My Project\\n\\nAt the Open Core Summit III, I presented a way of creating an AI-powered financial analyst capable of handling complex financial queries.\\n\\nI wrote more about this in this [blog post](/blog/creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst). This robust architecture can access 100+ financial datasets from OpenBB tools and reason about them. The code is open source here.\\n\\nI shared how our AI-powered financial analyst was able to answer\\n\\n> \u201cCheck what TSLA peers are. From those, check which one has the highest market cap. Then, for the ticker that has the highest market cap, get the most recent price target estimate from an analyst, and tell me who it was and on what date the estimate was made.\u201d\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nand\\n\\n> \u201cPerform a fundamentals financial analysis of AMZN using the most recently available data. What do you find that\u2019s interesting?\u201d\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nSince that was already working so well (watch the [presentation video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-43EKK2PhE&embeds_referring_euri=https://openbb.co/blog/creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE)), I wanted to bring these capabilities to Slack, show that this could be the future, and prove it would impact every analyst job.\\n\\nThat\u2019s when Goh Analyst was born.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nNote: Goh Analyst together is GOHANalyst, which is why the image is Gohan from Dragon Ball with the OpenBB logo on his forehead.\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nTo get started, you can see the [open-source repository and instructions](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-slack-agent/tree/main).\\n\\nFirst, I forked the [open-source code of the OpenBB agents repository](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-agents) that we have been using for R&D. This repository contains all the code for the OpenBB agent and has access to 100+ financial datasets.\\n\\nThen, I modified it to my needs:\\n\\nCreated the Slack bot interface\\n\\nWhen a Slack message mentions @Gohanalyst this workflow gets triggered\\n\\nWhen the Slack message contains the word \u201cOpenBB\u201d, I send that message through the OpenBB agent since the assumption is that data retrieval will be necessary. Otherwise, it goes straight through OpenAI.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, this is what the architecture looks like:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"800\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nI made Goh Analyst slightly sarcastic to make it a bit more fun. This makes interacting in a public channel somewhat more human and exciting.

I have moved countries. It turns out that there\'s a lot in common between these.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nRecently, I wrote a blogpost about the [difference in culture between London and San Francisco](/blog/moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed). I convinced my wife and dogs, packed our bags, and didn\'t look back. After all, I would live in the city with the highest density of builders per capita.\\n\\n**But why?**\\n\\nMost of my friends and family didn\'t understand why I would leave London. I liked the city, I enjoyed my lifestyle, I had friends, I played football with the same group every week, had dinner at the same restaurants, was close to family, and wouldn\'t be able to save money.\\n\\nLogically speaking, this move didn\'t make any sense. No one really told me that I was doing the right thing, but internally, I knew I had to.\\n\\nI believe this isn\'t so different from creating a startup. This blog post will explain what they have in common and why I did it.\\n\\n## Creating a startup / Deciding to leave your country\\n\\n[Elad Gil](http://eladgil.com/) wrote a really good [article](https://blog.eladgil.com/p/startups-are-an-act-of-desperation) on how creating a startup is an act of desperation. I believe that post could be equally applicable to moving countries, so I will list the same points used by Elad in the context of moving countries and provide examples. Most of the time, the person moving countries has a mix of the below bullet points.\\n\\n> **Career desperation.** Startups allow people early or stuck in their careers to jump a few steps ahead.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis applies equally to moving, and is why I left Portugal to pursue an MSc at Imperial College London.\\n\\n> **Financial desperation.** If successful, a startup will also leapfrog you financially.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis is the biggest motivation for people to move countries. This is why I was born in Switzerland, even though my parents are Portuguese. Having blue-collar jobs, they emigrated to a country with a better economy to provide my brother and me with a better life.\\n\\n> **Product or mission desperation.** The other reason startups often exist is that the founders are desperate for a product to exist in the world.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nIn this case, it\'s the equivalent of hearing about Silicon Valley in documentaries or watching Steve Jobs presenting the iPhone in 2007. You cannot ignore that as an engineer, so you are desperate to move to be part of that tech scene.\\n\\n> **Desperation to do something big or important, and to avoid wasted time.** Some people want to \\"make a dent in the universe\\" and are motivated by doing something useful with their lives.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis is what the \\"American dream\\" is all about. People moved to the US to do something bigger than themselves and achieve the promised dream.\\n\\n> **Revenge vs the Arena**\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe equivalent to this is when someone returns to their home country after several years outside with more wealth and/or experience.\\n\\n## Growing a startup / Living abroad\\n\\n### Mission and Vision\\n\\nWhen creating a company, you must have a clear mission and vision. This allows you to create a community/team that will be with you for the long run. Similarly, when moving countries, it\'s essential to have a well-defined goal. This doesn\'t mean that the goal cannot change; after all, companies pivot. However, you need to have a strategy that you follow until you don\'t.\\n\\n### Risk and Uncertainty\\n\\nStartups and moving to a new country both involve stepping into the unknown. Entrepreneurs often take financial and personal risks, while those moving countries leave behind familiar surroundings, support systems, and sometimes even their careers. Uncertainty becomes a constant companion, demanding adaptability, problem-solving skills, and the ability to embrace change with open arms.\\n\\n### Cultural Integration and Networking\\n\\nBuilding a successful startup requires networking, forming strategic partnerships, and understanding the market. Similarly, when moving countries, one must navigate cultural differences, learn new languages, and establish a network of contacts. Expanding social circles, building relationships, and immersing oneself in the local culture contribute to personal growth and enhance professional opportunities, just like in the startup world.\\n\\n### Resilience and Persistence\\n\\nBuilding a startup and moving countries demands unwavering resilience and persistence in facing challenges. Startups encounter setbacks, pivots, and failures, but successful entrepreneurs persist and learn from their experiences. Similarly, moving countries can bring unexpected hurdles, such as language barriers, difficulties making friends, challenges adapting to a new culture, or not finding a routine. Embracing these challenges with determination and adaptability paves the way for growth and achievement.\\n\\n### Learning and Growth\\n\\nStartups and moving countries are transformative experiences that offer immense personal and professional growth opportunities. Entrepreneurs continuously learn from their successes and failures in the startup world, refining their strategies and acquiring new skills. Likewise, moving countries provides a unique chance to learn about different cultures, broaden perspectives, and develop resilience, patience, and empathy. Both experiences foster personal development and shape individuals into more well-rounded and adaptable individuals.\\n\\n## Why did I do it?\\n\\nThe reason why I started OpenBB and also moved country is a combination of 2 factors:\\n\\n### Product or mission desperation.\\n\\nOn a startup level, I have experienced the need for an open-source investment research platform. That\'s why I wanted to create this platform, which was yet to exist. I think it wouldn\'t be possible if I didn\'t dedicate my time to it. This is why OpenBB\'s success is so important-it will enable millions of investors to have better access to data and better understand the financial market.\\n\\nGrowing up as an engineer fascinated by tech and innovation, the US has always been home to the biggest companies and hottest products. I\'ve always been attracted to Silicon Valley, but before OpenBB, I never had the chance to. The first job I applied to after finishing university was Waymo in CA, but they didn\'t sponsor VISAs for that role.\\n\\n### Desperation to do something big or important.\\n\\nOn a startup level, I want to work on something bigger than myself. I want to solve a problem that no one has solved before and build something useful for millions of people that can withstand time.\\n\\nI will do whatever it takes to build the first truly open-source investment research platform. Moving to SF increased my network opportunities with other entrepreneurs and builders from whom I can learn. I want to be fully immersed in this ecosystem and give it my all to do everything possible to help OpenBB succeed as a company, regardless of the outcome.\\n\\nNote: A few weeks ago, I moved to NYC because I truly believe living here would increase the chances of OpenBB\'s success compared to living in SF."},{"id":"moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed.md","title":"Moving from London to the Bay Area and what changed","description":"Moving from London to the Bay Area and what changed","date":"2024-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/learning"},{"inline":true,"label":"experience","permalink":"/blog/tags/experience"},{"inline":true,"label":"growth","permalink":"/blog/tags/growth"},{"inline":true,"label":"moving","permalink":"/blog/tags/moving"},{"inline":true,"label":"london","permalink":"/blog/tags/london"},{"inline":true,"label":"bay","permalink":"/blog/tags/bay"},{"inline":true,"label":"us","permalink":"/blog/tags/us"},{"inline":true,"label":"travel","permalink":"/blog/tags/travel"}],"readingTime":21.27,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed","title":"Moving from London to the Bay Area and what changed","date":"2024-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed.png","tags":["learning","experience","growth","moving","london","bay","us","travel"],"description":"Moving from London to the Bay Area and what changed"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Moving countries and starting a company ain\'t so different","permalink":"/blog/moving-countries-and-starting-a-company-aint-so-different"},"nextItem":{"title":"OpenBB Copilot is now available to all Terminal Pro users","permalink":"/blog/openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThe culture shock from moving to the Bay Area from London.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nA few months ago, I wrote a blogpost about what was needed in order for my wife and our 2 dogs to move to the Bay Area from London. You can check that blog post [here](/blog/leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco/).\\n\\nSince then, I\u2019ve had some people asking me after living in the Bay for 1 year, what are the biggest differences I\u2019ve experienced in terms of lifestyle & culture.\\n\\nI will write a section below for each of the major topics I experienced. Note that this is based on my experience, and you may disagree/have different opinions than me on some of these - which are very welcome.\\n\\n## Living costs\\n\\nBack in 2016 when I was at university, in Portugal, I used to pay 200 euros/month to live in an apartment with a roommate. My university cost was 800 euros/year and my parents gave me a monthly allowance of 300 euros/month to pay for food and anything else. I didn\u2019t do many activities and would rarely go out, so I was able to live comfortably on that.\\n\\nOnce I moved to London (in 2017) to pursue a MSc. at Imperial College I was paying 1.6k \xa3/month for a studio in Earl\u2019s Court. This was walking distance from Imperial (didn\u2019t have to pay for transportation) and was cheaper than the accommodations that the university offered. The university was no longer 800 euros/year, it cost \xa311k for the entire MSc (1 year).\\n\\nSo there was a shock that I experienced in terms of living costs from Lisbon to London.\\n\\nOnce I decided to move to the Bay Area (2023) I knew that the living costs were going to be higher, but in my head \u201chow higher can these be?\u201d.\\n\\nOh boy.\\n\\nApparently, a lot.\\n\\n### Shopping\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis was the first shopping trip I had in the Bay (Whole foods is the equivalent to Waitrose in London, I often still confuse them and my wife finds it funny - anyway, they call it whole paycheck here bc $$$). These 10 items cost me $69.34. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\\n\\nCostco is arguably my favorite shop. It\u2019s like a better IKEA. We would spend at least 2 hours shopping but we would get supplies for 3 weeks, the famous hot dog/pizza combo and put gas in the car. The membership (120$/year) pays itself really fast at Costco. The main downside is that since we were only 2 and I hate throwing food out, it happened a few times that I had to adapt my meals to make sure no food would go to waste. E.g. Eat a guacamole pack a day since the smaller pack brings 24 and it there were 24 days until the expiry date.\\n\\nPS: I like Costco so much that I always took the friends/family who visited to it, as if it was an attraction. Sometimes we would even go directly to Costco from the airport, to breathe in Costco and all its magnificence upon arrival :D\\n\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\" className=\\"flex items-center gap-2 justify-center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_2.png\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_3.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Apartment\\n\\nSince I went to the US with the sole purpose of working hard and making OpenBB successful, I ended up picking a nice apartment in San Mateo - given that we spend 90% of our time at home. Our monthly rent for a 2-bedroom flat was 4.4k $/month with everything included (including both dogs rent, lol).\\n\\nThe apartment had a small gym, a common pool & bbq area and an outdoor hot tub. But more importantly, it was located right by 101, walking distance from Peets & Starbucks and very pet friendly. In addition, I was 40m from SF, 10m from the airport and 20m from Palo Alto. This meant that we were in a very calm area whilst being close to the most important hubs.\\n\\nThe common pool and BBQ area (+ the sunny weather) were insane, sometimes I wish I had spent more time there. But I guess you tend to value things more when you don\u2019t have them :)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_4.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Tipping culture\\n\\nIn Europe, I very very rarely tipped. Not just me, but all people I know. It\u2019s just not part of our culture. Everything is factored in. Even in London, most restaurants will have a \u201cservice charge\u201d which is kind of a tip BUT it\u2019s included in the bill and so you don\u2019t need to think about how much you are going to tip.\\n\\nIn the US, if you don\u2019t tip - people will judge you. The system is done in a way that tipping is not a \u201cshould\u201d but closer to a \u201cmust\u201d. Workers rely on your tips when thinking about their total compensation. And now I understand why my friends who work in restaurants/cafes enjoy Americans so much, it\u2019s because they bring their tipping culture to Europe and so that extra money is very meaningful for European folks.\\n\\nSome rules that I follow:\\n\\n- If I go to a coffee shop and just do takeaway, I don\u2019t tip. If I sit down in a table, then I tip between 15-20%.\\n- When in a restaurant, I always tip. But the percentage varies based on the quality of the service and food. If I didn\u2019t like it, I still tip 10%. If I really enjoy it then I tip 20%. If it was just good, I do 15%. This is a rule of thumb. In practice, I do this but then round to a multiple of $5 because yes (this is the equivalent to my wife not allowing odd numbers as the TV volume).\\n\\nThe best way to get used to this is to just internally assume that 20% extra cost on whatever you are seeing on the menu. If a burger + drink costs $30, assume it will be $36 after taxes and tip.\\n\\nNote that in restaurants they expect you to leave your credit card on the top of the bill. This is so they can \u201cfreeze\u201d the bill and once they bring the receipt back they will wait for you to add the amount for the tip (+ total). Once you fill this and sign (in theory, the signing is mandatory) - only then they will be able to withdraw the bill amount + the tip.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_5.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## Sports\\n\\nGrowing up in Portugal I used to watch every Benfica game and then in high school you would talk about the games you watched during the weekend. There was no other sport, it was a binary - either you are a soccer fan or you don\u2019t watch any sports at all. When I moved to London, this changed slightly, there were people that liked other sports but Soccer was still the main sport by a very big margin. People would fill up a pub to watch Soccer only - maybe the other sport that came closest was Cricket.\\n\\nIn the US, people don\u2019t really care about Soccer. It feels like it\u2019s a sport that kids do, but adults don\u2019t really talk about it or watch it. They know about Messi/Ronaldo, but aren\u2019t really fans. On the other hand, American football, Basketball and Baseball are very big. Aquatic pole also seems to be popular in the Bay Area.\\n\\nI remember when we got the apartment, I was walking my dogs and there was a soccer pitch nearby. I was super happy because I thought that I could do what I used to do in London and just show up to the ground on the weekend and do a pick-up play with random folks. Unfortunately, after several attempts of walking nearby I realized that the pitch was only used for kids to play soccer and never adults. In London, on a sunny day, it\u2019s hard (maybe impossible?) to find a soccer field empty.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\" className=\\"flex items-center gap-2 justify-center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_6.png\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_7.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n### College sports\\n\\nWhile in Europe in general, no one cares about college sports. The reality in the US is completely different. Not only do they fill their stadiums with 50k+ people, but these games bring a TON of money. People will literally sit outside the stadium in the morning and wait for the time of the match. It\u2019s called tailgating.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_8.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\nI\u2019ve noticed that some people don\u2019t even go to the stadium, they just sit outside the stadium watching the game in the car park on their TV and drinking. I still don\u2019t fully get why you would do that, but I guess it\u2019s a tradition.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_9.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## Working Culture\\n\\nMy plan was to live in the US for the duration of my visa (O-1) and then return after 3 years. But the working culture is the reason why I hope to stay for longer. Most people you will meet in the Bay work very hard. They don\u2019t finish the day at 5/6pm but do long hours to get shit done. What motivates them is building the future and being part of something bigger than themselves.\\n\\nIn London, I felt like the culture was very strong towards finishing your working day and going to the pub at 5/6pm - get drunk. And then repeat. Before London I didn\u2019t drink alcohol, and in London I started drinking sometimes to socialize. In the Bay I feel like there isn\u2019t an expectation that everyone wants to drink, and people leave events early because they want to head home to work on something - which is something I used to do back in London.\\n\\nI also feel like in the Bay Area, when you go to events you can talk about what you are working on without people judging you for bringing \u201cwork\u201d into the conversation. And I tend to find these conversations more interesting. In London, there\u2019s less emphasis in tech, and the interests tend to be a bit broader: music, arts, history, etc..\\n\\nWhile people say that London is a big hub for startups & founders, I didn\u2019t find this to be the case. In the Bay Area, the likelihood of you encountering someone on the street and them working at a startup (most of the time their own) is really high. You can even feel the strength of this tech community on Twitter, whereas that doesn\u2019t exist (AFAIK) in London.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_10.png\\"/>\\n    <p>Elad Gil fireside with Satya Nadella at Stripe\'s HQ</p>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Equity as part of compensation package\\n\\nMost European startups do not offer any equity. In the Bay Area, all startups offer equity. The earlier you join (higher risk) the more meaningful the options you get are. One of the reasons this works is because US employees are, in general, hard-working and will go the long way for their company. So this makes it so that incentives are aligned, and employees want to work harder because that equity can become much more meaningful than their base salary (potentially life-changing).\\n\\nOne of the reasons this works so well is that pretty much every US person knows someone in firsthand who made f-u money by selling their shares in secondaries, or has at least heard stories about this. While I was in the UK, before starting OpenBB, I didn\u2019t hear about this once. Also because companies have no interest in offering you equity if they don\u2019t have to.\\n\\nE.g. at my previous startup I used to stay working late into the night, because in my perspective this would increase the startup\'s chances of success. However, I had no equity. So this meant that if the startup was wildly successful, I would have no direct gains from it and the company would not owe me anything. Offering equity through a typical 4-year vesting schedule (with 1-year cliff) provides the perfect type of alignment.\\n\\n### Holidays\\n\\nThe amount of holidays is a good example that demonstrates the hard-working culture that so well characterizes the US. In the US they are used to having 2-weeks off in a full calendar year. In London, most companies offer at least 4-weeks, which is effectively 2x the number of holidays.\\n\\n## Driving culture\\n\\nThe London underground works impressively, I lived there for 5 years and never once even considered owning a car.\\n\\nI thought I could do the same in the US and people were being dramatic. That thought lasted maybe 2 days?\\n\\nOn the first day I had to go to Fedex which was a 15-20m walk, and when I told the apartment administrator that I was going to walk there she looked at me like I was crazy and said \u201cyou need to take your car\u201d. After walking there I understood what she meant and that unless you are in a city, the pedestrian sidewalks/roads just aren\u2019t prepared for pedestrians.\\n\\n### Differences\\n\\n- You drive on the right (x2) side of the road. Since I didn\u2019t drive in the UK, this was very easy for me as I\u2019m used to driving in Portugal where we also drive on the right side of the road.\\n- In the UK (or Europe, in general) having more than 3 lanes on the highway is atypical. In the US, having 6 lanes it\u2019s considered normal. Sometimes it\u2019s tricky and you can\u2019t be in the most right side because the 2 right lanes may both exit and thus you need to hop over 2 lanes to keep on the same route. This mistake can be costly.\\n- There are very very few roundabouts in the Bay. There are a LOT of intersections. I like it less (not because I think it\u2019s slower) but because it\u2019s more \u201cboring\u201d to wait for the green light and from my point of view, people are more likely to grab their phone during that time because they don\u2019t need to pay as much attention, at least compared to a roundabout where you are waiting for an opening to keep moving. (there are so few roundabouts that the first time I saw one I took a picture to share with my wife)\\n- There\u2019s a \u201cRight on Red\u201d policy. This means that if you are at an intersection and it\u2019s red for you to proceed if there\u2019s no incoming car from the left side you can turn right on the red. I like this because it allows for traffic to flow better. My wife doesn\u2019t like it because as a pedestrian sometimes cars start accelerating and don\u2019t respect pedestrian as much. Nonetheless, I love to make this joke when people from Europe visit, where I say that I\u2019m going to pass a red and they are shocked when they see me turning right on a red light.\\n- In the Bay they have FastTrack which allows people to pay to use the most-left lane and avoid traffic. Although this is capitalist I like it because if I\u2019m in a rush I can pay a few dollars to avoid the congestion - it\u2019s a type of SaaS - Speed as a Service \ud83d\ude04\\n\\n### Waymo\\n\\nWaymo, a self-driving car division that started off Google, was the first startup I applied to when I finished university. I have been bullish on self-driving cars since university - my dissertation was on that topic and I had to propose it myself, since there were no proposals for such. So seeing Waymo operating in SF was mind-blowing to me.\\n\\nAutonomous cars are a matter of time - and SF (and the Bay Area) being the city where Waymo starts operating, shows a lot about how progressive this city is. I recommend everyone to try one out.\\n\\nMy dad, someone who was born and raised in a small town in Portugal, and who understands very little about technology seeing this was something. Him seated in the passenger\u2019s seat for the full 16 min drive recording a wheel with no driver and ending the journey telling me \u201cI never thought I would see this in my life, thank you\u201d is something that no amount of money in this world could buy.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\" className=\\"flex items-center gap-2 justify-center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_11.png\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_12.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Driving license\\n\\nEven though I have a Portuguese driving license since I was 18. That\u2019s only accepted for 10 days or so - and if you have an international driving license for it to work for longer (I didn\u2019t go this route). So I had to apply for a California Driving License (CDL) which meant taking a written exam and doing a driving test.\\n\\nThe written exam was actually fairly easy compared to the one I had in Portugal. In the Bay, the test consists of 36 multiple-choice questions, and you are allowed to fail up to 6 questions.  In Portugal I had 30 multiple-choice questions and could only fail up to 3.\\n\\nI found the written exam to be easy after doing multiple practice tests online. Most of the questions ended up being somewhat similar to the ones I had practiced the day before.\\n\\nDoing the written exam was very different though. In Portugal we did it in a closed room with someone watching us and everyone else in silence. In the Bay Area I did it in a corner of the DMV with a lot of background noise behind me. I had to use both my hands to cover my ears to be able to focus, which was annoying.\\n\\nThe driving exam is much easier than the one I did in Portugal. It lasted for maybe 20-25 minutes and it was just around the DMV. When doing it in Portugal, the test lasts 40 minutes and includes: parallel parking, reversing while tracking a curb (without touching it), stopping in a hill (harder when driving with a stick), roundabout and highway.\\n\\nAlso, the DMV is as bad as they say it is. This movie scene is pretty accurate:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_13.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## Cards\\n\\nIn the US, as in the UK, the driving license acts as citizen card. Even if you don\u2019t drive it\u2019s worth getting your drivers license since everywhere you go that is used for you to prove who you are.\\n\\nWhen doing anything official in the UK, you get asked about your passport (and the passport number). That ID is all they need to recognize who you are. In the US you have a Social Security Number (SSN) which is this super-confidential number that you are meant to keep secret, yet they keep asking you about it when you rent an apartment, set up a phone plan, go to the doctor, buy a car, \u2026 It\u2019s a weird concept. The difference is that in the UK if someone gets your passport number, nothing really happens. In the US if someone gets your SSN, it can be used to commit fraud, open new credit and bank accounts, obtain employment, and access medical care or other benefits.\\n\\n### Debit vs credit card\\n\\nIn Portugal and the UK, I only had a Debit card which had access to all the cash in the bank. When moving to the Bay Area, everyone told me to get a credit card and leave the debit card at home. There are a lot of scams in the US, and having a credit card is safer since banks limit the withdrawal amounts based on your credit score and will protect in case of theft.\\n\\nIn the UK, there isn\u2019t a concept of a credit score - at least publicly. Banks will have something like that based on how on time you pay for things, but it\u2019s only used internally for loans or others. In the US, everything revolves around your credit score. The amount of money you can withdraw from your credit card, the loans you get, the apartments you can rent, \u2026 so it\u2019s important to pay everything on time and avoid debt.\\n\\n## Employment\\n\\nEmployment in the US is very different from the one in the UK. \\n\\nIn the UK, you get paid a value at the end of the month that corresponds to the value you take home and the employer handles both your Income taxes and the National insurance (which goes to the NHS).\\n\\nIn the US, you need to handle your taxes at the end of a fiscal year. There are multiple taxes applied and hence it\u2019s not as simple as the tax system that exists in the UK.\\n\\nIn addition, there isn\u2019t a public \u201cfree\u201d NHS (healthcare) in the United States. As an individual, you need to select the plan you are interested in (based on a few choices that your employer offers you). Hence you need to consider not only what the monthly premium entails, but how the deductible works - and as weird as it sounds you need to \u201cestimate\u201d your likelihood of getting into an accident to select something that works for you. This is hard to grasp coming from a country where there\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d healthcare and everyone has access to the same services.\\n\\n## Others\\n\\n### Student debt\\n\\nIn Portugal, the concept of student debt doesn\u2019t really exist. In general, parents pay their kids\' tuition. This is possible because the tuition costs for public universities aren\u2019t very high.\\n\\nIn the UK, students tend to have student debt since university costs can be rather expensive (e.g. around 10k pounds/year). \\n\\nIn the US, student debt is much higher. We are talking about starting a career with 300k in student loans, which is absolutely wild.\\n\\n### Phone plan\\n\\nWhile I was paying around 8 pounds/month for my UK phone plan with unlimited data. For a similar plan in the US, the cost is around 70 $/month. A funny story about this is when I bought my phone plan, they told me that the cost was 70$ for their cheapest plan and I thought they meant yearly. When they told me it was monthly, I had to call my co-founder to make sure this wasn\u2019t a rip-off. To which he said: \u201cWelcome to the US\u201d.\\n\\n### Guns & Alcohol\\n\\nIn the UK (and Europe in general), it\u2019s illegal to own a gun and you can start drinking at 18 years old. In the US, you can buy a gun as soon as you are 18 but aren\u2019t allowed to drink until 21. \\n\\nAnd also, Kinder Surprise is illegal in the US because of the toy that comes inside. So you can\u2019t buy a chocolate with a toy inside because you can choke on it, but can go to the store to buy a gun.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\" className=\\"flex items-center gap-2 justify-center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_14.png\\" />\\n    <img width=\\"300\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_15.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n### Dog Parks\\n\\nOne of my all-time favorite things in the US and that Europe in general should learn from. The US has a LOT of dog parks. These are spaces that are gated where people bring their dogs for them to play together. These spaces come fully prepared with water, bags, cleaning kits and even seats. I\u2019ve seen friends hang out at the park while their dogs are having fun playing with other dogs. These parks usually also have 2 areas, one for smaller and one for larger dogs - which is great since we have a small pomeranian.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_16.png\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nOverall, I\'m very happy that I moved to the US. I think it was the right decision for both the company and my family. Plus the network that I\'m building between other founders, customers and investors is something that I couldn\'t have done in Europe."},{"id":"openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-02-27-openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-27-openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users.md","title":"OpenBB Copilot is now available to all Terminal Pro users","description":"Introducing the OpenBB Copilot, an ever-present financial analyst at your fingertips with the OpenBB Terminal Pro.","date":"2024-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"copilot","permalink":"/blog/tags/copilot"},{"inline":true,"label":"generative-ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/generative-ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"llm","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"}],"readingTime":4.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users","title":"OpenBB Copilot is now available to all Terminal Pro users","date":"2024-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-02-27-openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users.png","tags":["openbb","copilot","generative-ai","ai","llm"],"description":"Introducing the OpenBB Copilot, an ever-present financial analyst at your fingertips with the OpenBB Terminal Pro."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Moving from London to the Bay Area and what changed","permalink":"/blog/moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed"},"nextItem":{"title":"12 things I learned in 2023","permalink":"/blog/12-things-i-learned-in-2023"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-02-27-openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nFor the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been working on the OpenBB Copilot, an ever-present financial analyst at your fingertips with the OpenBB Terminal Pro.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nThe [OpenBB Copilo](https://openbb.co/use-cases/ai) is our latest addition to the [Terminal Pro](https://openbb.co/products/pro), and we could not be more excited to share it with you.\\n\\nIf you don\'t have access yet, join the [Terminal Pro waitlist](https://my.openbb.co/app/pro/early-access) and enjoy your 3-week free trial soon!\\n\\nNow, take a moment to meet your new **AI investment research partner**.\\n\\n\\n## What can the OpenBB Copilot do?\\n\\nOpenBB Copilot is multi-functional and can perform several tasks that are useful to analysts. We\u2019ll be exploring these below.\\n\\n\\n### Generic financial knowledge\\n\\nUsing OpenBB Copilot, you can ask any general financial question. For example:\\n\\n**What is the P/E ratio?**\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/7c8c9658-4c4d-4090-8a61-826de823981b\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\nAs an additional bonus feature, OpenBB Copilot includes a LaTeX renderer to display mathematical formulas and equations.\\n\\n\\n### Conversation capability\\n\\nOpenBB Copilot is a conversational agent and is, therefore, aware of the chat history of the current conversation.\\n\\nAs a result, you can ask follow-up questions and steer OpenBB Copilot toward your line of inquiry while developing an investment thesis.\\n\\nTo clear the message history, for example, when investigating a new asset, you can click on the trashcan icon to start a new conversation.\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/3e1170f2-59b4-458a-bc6e-cd86c688b8db\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\n\\n### Terminal Pro as context\\n\\nIf you ask questions about the data on the dashboard, OpenBB Copilot will query the Terminal Pro for the data necessary to answer your query.\\n\\nThe Copilot has access to the dashboard metadata on the backend and can decide to retrieve data from any of the widgets currently on your dashboard.\\n\\nIn most cases, if you can see the data on your dashboard, you can assume OpenBB Copilot has access to it.\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/6c22201f-67ce-49a7-ab4d-213b594c657b\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\nThis is an application of what\u2019s known in the AI world as function calling, which allows LLMs to interact with external systems.\\n\\nThe OpenBB Copilot can choose to automatically retrieve the data from your dashboard if it needs it to answer your query.\\n\\nThe advantage of this approach is that, since you can retrieve data from any widget, you can also expand OpenBB Copilot\u2019s knowledge by adding custom widgets or by bringing your own data to the Terminal Pro.\\n\\n\\n### Query specific widgets\\n\\nSometimes, you may wish to focus your analysis and use OpenBB Copilot with only a specific subset of widgets.\\n\\nFor example, you may want to use OpenBB Copilot to assist you in a deep analysis of an earnings transcript in the \\"Earnings Transcript\\" widget without retrieving data from the rest of the dashboard.\\n\\nTo achieve this, you can chat with specifically selected widgets by clicking on the \\"Add widgets as context\\".\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/dc74b30a-73ed-4b85-af23-9bb8ab9c844c\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\nSelecting a widget will make that widget\'s data available to OpenBB Copilot while excluding all the other widgets.\\n\\nYou can then use the Copilot as normal and the unselected widgets will be ignored by the Copilot.\\n\\n\\n### Query your own documents\\n\\nYou\u2019re also not limited by the data that is available in Terminal Pro.\\n\\nYou can upload your own documents for OpenBB Copilot to use as context while answering your queries.\\n\\nOpenBB Copilot currently supports txt, PDF, CSV and XLSX documents.\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/dec690c2-ed07-40c1-8b3e-ff0ad7294258\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\n### Citations\\n\\nWe understand that sometimes getting an answer from an AI chatbot with financial knowledge isn\u2019t satisfactory.\\n\\nYou often want to do further research or do your own fact-checking of the sources used to answer to your query.\\n\\nThat is why OpenBB Copilot provides citations as part of its answers.\\n\\nWhen using the Terminal Pro as context or chatting with your uploaded data files, the Copilot will cite which data sources it used to formulate the answers.\\n\\nSimply mouse over the citation to see which widget data was used, or which uploaded file was referenced. For PDF document specifically, the Copilot will also source the specific page that was used to answer your query.\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/e35a0b2c-8150-4d2b-9743-a72862ba3b6d\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\n## What if you don\'t want to use our copilot?\\n\\nYou don\u2019t have to. That is the reason we came up with the Bring Your Own Copilot concept.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re an OpenBB Terminal Pro user, you\u2019re able to bring your own financial Copilot that has been fine-tuned and tweaked on your enterprise\u2019s private data.\\n\\nThis provides an edge to financial firms as they can access their own fine-tuned LLM with access to real-time data provided by the OpenBB Terminal Pro - making this the perfect combo to perform investment research.\\n\\nWe have an [open-source repository](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/copilot-for-terminal-pro/tree/main) to help you make your own copilots accessible on the Terminal Pro.\\n\\nYou can also see the video below:\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/2703e8d8-2497-40ab-b513-678d78989f5b\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nCheck out our [AI page](https://openbb.co/use-cases/ai) to learn more about these features and stay updated in the future."},{"id":"12-things-i-learned-in-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/12-things-i-learned-in-2023","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-01-22-12-things-i-learned-in-2023.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-22-12-things-i-learned-in-2023.md","title":"12 things I learned in 2023","description":"The 12 things I learned in 2023","date":"2024-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"learnings","permalink":"/blog/tags/learnings"},{"inline":true,"label":"reflection","permalink":"/blog/tags/reflection"},{"inline":true,"label":"leadership","permalink":"/blog/tags/leadership"},{"inline":true,"label":"startup","permalink":"/blog/tags/startup"},{"inline":true,"label":"growth","permalink":"/blog/tags/growth"},{"inline":true,"label":"product-management","permalink":"/blog/tags/product-management"},{"inline":true,"label":"user-experience","permalink":"/blog/tags/user-experience"},{"inline":true,"label":"decision-making","permalink":"/blog/tags/decision-making"},{"inline":true,"label":"life-lessons","permalink":"/blog/tags/life-lessons"}],"readingTime":4.26,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"12-things-i-learned-in-2023","title":"12 things I learned in 2023","date":"2024-01-22T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-01-22-12-things-i-learned-in-2023.png","tags":["learnings","reflection","leadership","startup","growth","product-management","user-experience","decision-making","life-lessons"],"description":"The 12 things I learned in 2023"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"OpenBB Copilot is now available to all Terminal Pro users","permalink":"/blog/openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing the OpenBB Add-in for Excel","permalink":"/blog/introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-22-12-things-i-learned-in-2023.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nThe 12 things I learned in 2023\\n\\n### 1. Don\'t delegate anything that you wouldn\'t do yourself.\\n\\nIt\'s extremely important to work on little things to show your team that nothing is too small to spend time on, and sets a precedent that you are willing to work on the ground next to them.\\n\\nE.g. Elon Musk sleeping at the gigafactory to show his team that he was there next to them.\\n\\n### 2. Be curious and humble enough to be willing to ask dumb questions.\\n\\nIf I don\'t know something, I never pretend understanding what the person is talking about.\\n\\nI would take the knowledge over a \\"smart\\" label, any day.\\n\\n### 3. Implement feedback loops on everything you do, otherwise you can\'t adapt.\\n\\nLast year I decided to work on [tracking our employee engagement](https://openbb.co/company/open/team), and this is one of the best and most valuable initiatives I have worked on.\\n\\nIt has provided us tons of feedback that we were able to act on, and improve what it\'s like to work for OpenBB. More information on this [here](https://openbb.co/blog/employee-engagement).\\n\\n### 4. UX is more important than UI.\\n\\nI keep seeing tweets about UI improvements on a website and/or product. I love that type of posts, and wish there was a similar trend going on for UX improvements.\\n\\nWhile UI is critical to attract users, UX is king to retain them.\\n\\nIt\'s like dating - the looks is in the UI and the personality is the UX.\\n\\nWhile they may be perceived as their own separate bubble, they are not. Someone with an amazing personality (UX) will appear as more beautiful (UI).\\n\\n### 5. If in presence of a 2-way door decision, you should decide fast.\\n\\nBeing fast to decide to do A instead of B in a 2-way door decision is ideal because even if that wasn\'t the correct decision, adapting after will still be better than being stuck at the decision stage.\\n\\nPlus, you\'ll be surprised by how many time you actually get it right given the level of context and knowledge you have in the space.\\n\\nKnowing what is a 1 and a 2-way door decision, separates great from poor leaders.\\n\\nI like [this video](https://tiktok.com/@evancarmichael/video/7317081673865235717) from Jeff Bezzos talking about this.\\n\\n### 6. There\'s a ton of data in intuition and common sense.\\n\\nAs a leader, most of the times you have to make decisions with no hard data evidence. And by hard data I mean a spreadsheet with numbers or a powerpoint with charts.\\n\\nHowever, you do have that data. It\'s just not in a clean format and lives on your head.\\n\\nThis data has been aggregating by spending more time thinking about the problem you are solving than anyone else, by talking with customers, by talking with partners, and everything in between.\\n\\nTrust your intuition, more often than not presentations are done to justify decisions that you knew were right all along. Skip that and you will be able to move faster.\\n\\n### 7. Hear feedback from everyone but only listen from a few.\\n\\nPeople paying for your product, will provide you 10x feedback compared to others. Use common sense for others.\\n\\n### 8. Be there for your team.\\n\\nMake sure to remind your team that you couldn\'t do it without them.\\n\\nA single off-line event per year is not enough.\\n\\nShow that you care by being there: asking about their family/pets/hobbies, messaging them when they perform above expectations, send them gifts when something negative happens, ... act like a friend but manage like a captain\\n\\n### 9. Fire B and C players early. \\n\\nKeeping a team of A players is hard but extremely rewarding, and necessary. \\n\\nIt sets the precedent that average work is not enough to work at your company, and high performers will want to work for you to be surrounded by people that push them everyday.\\n\\n### 10. Distribution is more important than product.\\n\\nTook me some time to understand this, but I have no doubts about this now.\\n\\nThis is why the sentence of \\"A good product with great distribution will almost always beat a great product with poor distribution.\\"\\n\\n### 11. Leave your comfort zone.\\n\\nI\'m really shy on stage and this year I\'ve presented a few times. And I\'ve impressed myself, while I\'m far from good I\'ve come a long way.\\n\\nWhen i started learning english my goal was to be able to make people laugh in english, that took a while.\\n\\nI\'ve now been able to make people laugh whilst on stage and I didn\'t expect that I\'d be able to do this anytime soon.\\n\\n### 12. Tell your loved ones how much they mean to you.\\n\\nMost of us have someone by our side that allow us to keep performing at highest level day in and day out.\\n\\nEnsure they know you couldn\'t be the person you are today without them."},{"id":"introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-01-17-introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-17-introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel.md","title":"Introducing the OpenBB Add-in for Excel","description":"We acknowledged the enduring centrality of Excel in the financial sector, so we\'re now making data from the Terminal Pro readily available in Excel.

After conducting over 100 interviews with analysts and quants, three key insights surfaced:\\n\\n1. The financial world runs on Excel.\\n\\n2. The primary value of the OpenBB Terminal Pro lies in its customization (bring your own data + widget/dashboard creation) and AI features.\\n\\n3. The financial world, **LITERALLY**, still runs on Excel.\\n\\nFor topic number 2, we were well underway towards building the [Terminal Pro](https://openbb.co/products/pro) as the most customizable and efficient financial terminal.\\n\\nBut for topics number 1 and 3, we weren\u2019t.\\n\\nSo we devised a small task force to tackle this effort and work with design partners towards building the [OpenBB Add-in for Excel](https://openbb.co/products/excel).\\n\\nThe goal was simple: **financial data available on the Terminal Pro should be accessible in Excel**.\\n\\nBut as we do for all our products, we wanted to understand where this product would sit in our ecosystem.\\n\\nSince the Terminal Pro offers a basic data tier (including historical price, fundamentals, analyst estimates, news, macro-economy, and forex) with redistribution rights, we decided to make those same datasets available in Excel.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-17-introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nSo, in simple terms, we allow the user to access financial data right from Excel, by connecting with the OpenBB server to do the data request.\\n\\nIn the example below you can see that we are using the formula `=OBB.EQUITY.ESTIMATES.PRICE_TARGET(\\"AAPL\\")` which retrieves the latest data about AAPL\u2019s price target.\\n\\nYou can read more information about it in our [Documentation](https://docs.openbb.co/excel/reference/equity/estimates/price_target).\\n\\nThis is how it looks:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-17-introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis was a huge step for us.\\n\\nHowever, another question came up:\\n\\n**As the datasets keep expanding, discoverability will become a big problem.**\\n\\nAnd we haven\u2019t been around for 40 years for users to be familiar with our terminology.\\n\\nSo, how would users know what function to use, to access the datasets they are interested in?\\n\\nWe figured that enterprise users would be interested in accessing the data they are already visualizing in the [OpenBB Terminal Pro](https://openbb.co/products/pro).\\n\\nSo we allowed them to get the Excel function directly from each widget:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-17-introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nAfter clicking on the \u201cFunctions\u201d button in the ellipsis icon of the widget data you are interested in, this is what a user sees:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-17-introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel_4.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Templates\\n\\nSince [OpenBB Terminal Pro](https://my.openbb.co/app/pro) users are used to the templates they have access to with our product, e.g. our equity analyst template:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-17-introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel_5.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nWe ensured that similar templates were available for the Excel Add-in, and you can find them [here](https://my.openbb.co/app/excel/templates).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-17-introducing-the-openbb-add-in-for-excel_6.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## What\'s Next\\n\\nLast but not least, we are working on the upcoming integration of the \\"Bring Your Own Data\\" (BYOD) feature into our Excel Add-in.\\n\\nUntil now, this capability has been exclusive to the OpenBB Terminal Pro and is a **cornerstone of our offering**.\\n\\nBut it doesn\u2019t have to stop there.\\n\\nOur foundation on an open-source platform empowers us to facilitate open data access across multiple interfaces, whether through the Terminal Pro or the Excel Add-in.\\n\\nWe expect this to be a complete game-changer in the industry. While numerous financial Excel add-ins exist, they lack the flexibility to seamlessly incorporate third-party or proprietary datasets.\\n\\nWe are currently working with design partners on this. So if this sounds like something you are interested in - please reach out.\\n\\nWe have a 5,000+ [waitlist](https://my.openbb.co/app/pro/early-access) to the Terminal Pro and have already started onboarding users. As part of the Terminal Pro free trial, you will be granted access to the OpenBB Add-in for Excel as long as you have Microsoft Excel.\\n\\nWondering how to get started easily?

We are a team of 20, and I\'m the only one in SF. So when I wake up, most of the team is already half a day in or has just wrapped up.\\n\\nThat means that I always spend the first 30 minutes of the day reading messages to catch-up on everything.\\n\\nAnd tonight felt like hacking something quick.\\n\\nSo I created a script that:\\n\\n* Reads all Slack messages from the time I go to bed\\n* Summarizes the conversation of each channel\\n* The bot sends me a message with this summary\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nClone the open source project [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/slackGPT).\\n\\n### Slack API\\n\\n1. Go to [Slack API page](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app.\\n\\n2. Install the app in the workspace you are interested in summarizing Slack messages.\\n\\n3. Get the User OAuth Token which exists in the Install App settings. This will be needed to use Slack\'s SDK. Set this value as the `SLACK_TOKEN` on a `.env` file if you want to run the script locally or as a GitHub secret if you want to leverage the GitHub workflow.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-15-slack-gpt-summarizing-messages_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n4. Create a **Webhook URL** for your channel so that you can receive messages\' summary. Set this value as the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`` on a `.env` file if you want to run the script locally or as a GitHub secret if you want to leverage the GitHub workflow.\\n\\n5. Depending on the type of access needed, different **User Token Scopes** need to be set. Here\'s the methods that we will need and the associated user token scopes.\\n    - conversations_history: This method retrieves a conversation\'s history of messages and events. It requires the **channels:history** scope for public channels, or **groups:history** for private channels and im:history for direct messages.\\n\\n    - users_info: This method returns information about a user. It requires the **users:read** scope.\\n\\n    - conversations_info: This method retrieves information about a conversation. It requires the **channels:read** scope for public channels, or **groups:read** for private channels and im:read for direct messages.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-15-slack-gpt-summarizing-messages_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### OpenAI API\\n\\nGo to [OpenAI API page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to extract the API key. Set this value as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` on a `.env` file if you want to run the script locally or as a GitHub secret if you want to leverage the GitHub workflow.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-15-slack-gpt-summarizing-messages_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Slack channels\\n\\nGet the Channel IDs that you are interested in reading messages from.\\n\\nSet those values as the `SLACK_CHANNEL_IDS` on a `.env` file if you want to run the script locally or as a GitHub secret if you want to leverage the GitHub workflow. If you want to read from multiple channels you can set `SLACK_CHANNEL_IDS` with multiple IDs separated by commas (with no space), e.g. ABC123,DEF456,GHI789.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-15-slack-gpt-summarizing-messages_4.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Running\\n\\nAfter you fork the project [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/slackGPT), there are 2 ways you can run the code.\\n\\n1. Ad-hoc by running the python script with `python slackgpt.py`\\n\\n2. Automatically, by leveraging GitHub actions. For this you will need to set up GitHub secrets and you can modify [this workflow](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/slackGPT/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) in order to change the frequency of the messages sumary. \\n\\nThe most important part of this script is the `cron: \'0 8 * * 1-5\'` which specifies the frequency. In this case, the expression means that the task will run at 8:00 AM from Monday to Friday, and breaks down as follows:\\n\\n- 0: Specifies the minute when the task will run (in this case, 0 minutes).\\n\\n- 8: Specifies the hour when the task will run (in this case, 8 AM).\\n\\n- *: Represents any day of the month, meaning the task is not restricted to a specific day.\\n\\n- *: Represents any month, meaning the task is not restricted to a specific month.\\n\\n- 1-5: Specifies the days of the week when the task will run (Monday to Friday).\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nBy inputting the following text on the Slack channel of my choice:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-15-slack-gpt-summarizing-messages_5.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThe SlackGPT summarized it as follows:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-15-slack-gpt-summarizing-messages_6.png\\"/>\\n</p>"},{"id":"building-my-personal-website-in-docusaurus","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/building-my-personal-website-in-docusaurus","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-01-08-building-my-personal-website-in-docusaurus.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-08-building-my-personal-website-in-docusaurus.md","title":"Building my personal website in Docusaurus","description":"How I\'m using Docusaurus to build my own personal website.","date":"2024-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus"},{"inline":true,"label":"website","permalink":"/blog/tags/website"},{"inline":true,"label":"blog","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog"}],"readingTime":1.54,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"building-my-personal-website-in-docusaurus","title":"Building my personal website in Docusaurus","date":"2024-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-01-08-building-my-personal-website-in-docusaurus.png","tags":["docusaurus","website","blog"],"description":"How I\'m using Docusaurus to build my own personal website."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"SlackGPT - Your Slack bot that summarizes unread messages","permalink":"/blog/slack-gpt-summarizing-messages"},"nextItem":{"title":"Prediction for 2024","permalink":"/blog/prediction-for-2024"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-08-building-my-personal-website-in-docusaurus.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nHow I\'m using Docusaurus to build my own personal website.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nOne of my goals for 2023 was to learn web development. Given that I knew 0 to nothing last year, I am extremely happy with my progress.\\n\\nI never had the time to fully dedicate to it in terms of doing a program/course \u2014 but as with anything in life, the best way to learn is by doing.\\n\\nAnd this year I worked on web development for:\\n\\n* OpenBB Hub \u2014 https://my.openbb.co\\n* OpenBB marketing website \u2014 https://openbb.co\\n* OpenBB docs \u2014 https://docs.openbb.co\\n* OpenBB Terminal Pro \u2014 https://pro.openbb.co\\n\\nThank you Jos\xe9 Donato for always helping me with anything!\\n\\nIn addition, I\u2019ve always wanted to have my own personal website.

And at the time I became very familiar with Docusaurus, which is what we use for OpenBB docs.\\n\\nSo I thought \u2014 why not just use Docusaurus to make my personal website? It\u2019s easy to edit, I\u2019m already very familiar with the architecture, and it\u2019s very easy to update when there\u2019s new information.\\n\\nSo that\u2019s what I did, and also made the entire code open source here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website\\n\\nYou can access the full website here \u2014 https://didierlopes.com/, and there you can find: my personal projects, books I\u2019ve read or want to read, interviews/webinars/podcasts, resume or even my blog.\\n\\nAny feedback is welcome."},{"id":"prediction-for-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/prediction-for-2024","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2024-01-01-prediction-for-2024.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-01-prediction-for-2024.md","title":"Prediction for 2024","description":"Companies will own multiple fine-tuned LLMs/SLMs for specific tasks.","date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/finance"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"agents","permalink":"/blog/tags/agents"},{"inline":true,"label":"copilot","permalink":"/blog/tags/copilot"},{"inline":true,"label":"llm","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"inline":true,"label":"pro","permalink":"/blog/tags/pro"},{"inline":true,"label":"fine-tune","permalink":"/blog/tags/fine-tune"}],"readingTime":1.92,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"prediction-for-2024","title":"Prediction for 2024","date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2024-01-01-prediction-for-2024.png","tags":["openbb","finance","ai","agents","copilot","llm","pro","fine-tune"],"description":"Companies will own multiple fine-tuned LLMs/SLMs for specific tasks."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Building my personal website in Docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/building-my-personal-website-in-docusaurus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Creating an AI-powered financial analyst","permalink":"/blog/creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2024-01-01-prediction-for-2024.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nCompanies will own multiple fine-tuned LLMs/SLMs for specific tasks.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nLLMs like ChatGPT are great for showing what these models are capable of doing in terms of breadth, but at the end of the day, you\u2019re going to look for depth. Instead of relying on one-size-fits-all solutions, companies will look towards the integration of multiple, fine-tuned language models tailored for specific actions.\\n\\nEnterprises are recognizing the importance of accuracy in their AI applications. General-purpose language models have been revolutionary, but the demand for specialized models is on the rise. From customer support interactions to complex data analysis, having dedicated language models for specific tasks enhances accuracy and efficiency. This is easy to understand since the weights that are being used for the LLM to have a big breadth of knowledge are repurposed for depth.\\n\\nPersonalization is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Specialized language models enable enterprises to deliver personalized experiences to their customers. We have to assume that everyone is utilizing the same models today, so offering ChatGPT in your product isn\u2019t good enough. You need to add alpha to it. And that is done through fine-tuning utilizing your private data.\\n\\nIn an era of increasing cyber threats and stringent regulations, the deployment of fine-tuned language models allows enterprises to enhance their security measures and ensure compliance with industry standards.\\n\\nAs for the financial industry, this is 100% going to happen. Firms will fine-tune language models locally utilizing their proprietary datasets and providing access to their Snowflake/Elastic/ClickHouse/.. instances. This collection of models will effectively enhance the productivity of the firm by 2/3x, even displacing jobs.\\n\\nWe are preparing for this shift at OpenBB and I spent the last few days working on a proof-of-concept with Jos\xe9 Donato that will allow users to bring their own copilots to the Terminal Pro.

We recently [announced the OpenBB Platform](https://openbb.co/blog/goodbye-openbb-sdk-hello-openbb-platform) and have refactored it from the ground up to make it easier and simpler for quants/developers to access financial data. In addition, we hired a new head of AI to lead our AI efforts - you can read more about it [here](https://openbb.co/blog/revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig).\\n\\nI did a 20-minute presentation at the Open Core Summit on this topic that you can watch here:\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-43EKK2PhE?si=o_lO_lVLpWwwfbvF\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nOtherwise, the following post will summarize what we presented.\\n\\n## AI-Powered financial analyst roadmap\\n\\nWhen discussing what tasks we wanted our AI-powered Financial Analyst to be able to perform, we arrived at the following levels (in order of complexity):\\n\\n1. **Knowledge retrieval**: The agent can answer general financial queries without external resources. (eg. ChatGPT \\"as-is\\"). Here, the agent relies solely on its training data to answer questions.\\n\\n2. **Data retrieval**: The agent can answer queries using information inserted into the context (usually as part of a separate data retrieval process that isn\'t controlled by the model, such as using [similarity search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_search) across a knowledge database using the user\'s query).\\n\\n3. **Autonomous data retrieval**: The agent can answer queries by dynamically retrieving data not currently present in the context or the training data via function calling.\\n\\n4. **Complex workflow execution**: The agent can reason and answer queries that require a logical arrangement of knowledge retrieval, data retrieval, and autonomous data retrieval calling. It includes action planning and decision-making.\\n\\n5. **Fully autonomous analyst**: The agent can do all of the above but is self-directed. The agent can dynamically generate additional hypotheses, modify plans of action, and retrieve the necessary data, all while mid-workflow. The agent can make arguments for certain decisions, carry a discussion on the topic, and reason with you.\\n\\nOur goal is to enable OpenBB Copilot to perform all of the above. I presented a demo of how it would work in this video:\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1rYmWWVbIY?si=ShScenxTI4bHtERS\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n## Two types of prompts\\n\\nRather than first building an AI-powered financial analyst for the sake of it, we instead started from what we wanted to achieve. We came up with two distinct prompts and our goal was for the agent to be able to successfully perform both of these, but utilizing the same underlying \\"agentic\\" architecture.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n- **Prompt A (on the left)** - requires linear reasoning (where future answers depend on previous answers). This kind of prompt is generally deterministic, which allows us to access (and verify) the agent\'s answers immediately because we can check the underlying facts and data. It also involves a few complex operations across multiple steps, such as extracting a list of tickers from an endpoint and iterating through that list using a different endpoint. Then based on those outputs, a reasoning can be made and a final answer is given.\\n\\n- **Prompt B (on the right)** - requires independent reasoning (fetching and combining different pieces of independent information). This prompt is typically less deterministic and allows us to leverage LLMs to provide alpha by uncovering insights that would be hard for a human to discover (or, at the very least, discover at scale). Instead of telling the agent what to do explicitly, we instead pose a question and expect the agent to execute an analysis and perform reasoning, without specific guidance or guardrails.\\n\\n## OpenBB Platform\\n\\nGetting started with our Platform is extremely easy (docs [here](https://docs.openbb.co/platform)). All you need is `pip install openbb` and you are ready to access 100+ different datasets.\\n\\nWe standardize the data so that you can read our docs once and interact with the Platform the same way, regardless of the type of data you are looking at.\\n\\nIn addition, using the OpenBB Hub, you can set up your API keys which we can manage on your behalf, and all you need to access data via OpenBB is a Personal Access Token.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nCrucially, we use Pydantic for all of our endpoints. This ensures that we have both structured inputs and structured outputs. This is extremely important as we feed these models into our agent so that it understands both the input schema during function calling, but also the output schema of the resulting function call. This is standardized across multiple data vendors across the OpenBB Platform.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### OpenBB Tools\\n\\nFrom having 100+ different data endpoints that you can access using Python, we created \\"tools\\" that an agent \\"understands\\" and can use. This is extremely important since this collection of tools will give real-time data to the agent based on the prompt asked.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_4.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nSince the OpenBB Platform has high-quality documentation, we use each function\'s docstring as well as the output field names (with some basic preprocessing). This tweak allows the agent to know where to get the market cap information from, even if it\'s within a differently-named endpoint (for example the `equity.fundamentals.overview` endpoint).\\n\\nEach of these tool descriptions is converted into embeddings that can be retrieved later on based on the query the user provides. This allows our agent to pick the right tools for the job - i.e. if I want to have access to Apple\'s market cap, I want to get the tool `equity.fundamentals.overview` because I know that by providing the symbol `AAPL` I can get the market cap value.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_5.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nSo, we create a vector store using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) and OpenAIEmbeddings, although any vector store with similarity search would also work.\\n\\n## OpenBB Agent Architecture\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"900\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_6.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis is the overall architecture that our agent will follow, and below we will talk about each of these components individually.\\n\\n### Task Decomposition\\n\\nFirst of all, we don\'t want to tackle the user query in one go. This is because LLMs have limited context. Plus, we want the agent to retrieve all the necessary tools to answer the query. But the vector\'s store similarity search doesn\'t work with one prompt that needs multiple different tools. Additionally, similar to human analysts, breaking a larger question up into smaller manageable subquestions leads to better analysis and results.\\n\\nSo, we break the user\'s main query into:\\n\\n- **List of simpler tasks**: self-explanatory\\n\\n- **List of tasks dependency**: does the current subtask need a prior subtask to tackle the current subtask?\\n\\n- **List of \\"tool search\\" keywords associated with each subtask**: instead of using the subtask question itself to directly retrieve the correct selection of tools using the embeddings in the vector store, empirically we found that if the LLM could select the most important keywords associated with the task using keyword search. This ended up resulting in a big jump in retrieval performance. This is expected since we are effectively reducing the noise. E.g. \\"What are Tesla peers\\" \u2192 \\"peers\\".\\n\\nThis is the system message we are utilizing:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_7.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nTo ensure that we have a structured output with the format specified, we create a Pydantic Data model to be used as format in the instruction:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_8.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis is what the code looks like, and you can see that the `PydanticOutputParser` goes into the `format_instructions`:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_9.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Tool Retrieval\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_10.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis is the function that the agent uses to retrieve the right subset of tools to answer each of the subtasks. Empirically, we found good results by using the similarity score threshold of 0.65. In other words, we retrieve all tools with descriptions that return a better similarity score than that value. In the case where the search yields less than two tools, we return the 2 tools with the highest similarity score instead.\\n\\nAs previously mentioned, you can see that we are not using the subtask query itself but the keywords associated with it. The embeddings of the keywords are (from experimentation) closer to the embeddings of the correct docstring by focusing solely on a few keywords rather than the entire sentence.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_11.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Subtask Agents\\n\\nEach subtask agent is provided with the original query from the user, one of the subtasks from the task decomposition step, the output from another subtask agent IF there was a subtask dependency AND a set of retrieved tools necessary to answer the subtask.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_12.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis is what the agent looks like:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_13.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Final Agent\\n\\nWe then combine the entire context from subquestions and outputs to be given to the final agent:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_14.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nFinally, we give the final agent the main prompt and the list of tasks from task decomposition and that\'s it!\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_15.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## OpenBB Results\\n\\n### Prompt A\\n\\n_\\"Check what are TSLA peers. From those, check which one has the highest market cap. Then, on the ticker that has the highest market cap get the most recent price target estimate from an analyst, and tell me who it was and on what date the estimate was made.\\"_\\n\\nThe output can be seen here:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_16.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nSince this is a deterministic workflow, we can look at the raw data to check whether the output is correct or not - which we can validate below.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_17.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n### Prompt B\\n\\n_\\"Perform a fundamentals financial analysis of AMZN using the most recently available data. What do you find that\'s interesting?\\"_\\n\\nThe output can be seen here:\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_18.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-27-creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst_19.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nAs can be seen above, the results are extremely impressive. We achieved this with a couple of weeks of work, but there are still a lot of areas that we can improve and in which we are currently working on. However, the current results make this an extremely exciting space to be.\\n\\nAll this work is open source and can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-agents).\\n\\nWe are just getting started."},{"id":"the-new-finai-tech-stack","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-new-finai-tech-stack","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-12-15-the-new-finai-tech-stack.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-15-the-new-finai-tech-stack.md","title":"The new FinAI Tech Stack","description":"This blog post delves into how our collaboration with MindsDB, Nixtla, LlamaIndex, and Langchain is revolutionizing the financial world.

Read on to learn all about the event \\"The New FinAI Tech Stack\\" held last week in SF, California.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nIn early September, I attended a \u201cFuture of Finance\u201d event in NYC. Despite the presence of well-known financial professionals from top firms in the industry, I found the event lacked practical applications demonstrating how AI is impacting the financial sector.\\n\\nOnce I was back in the Bay Area, I had a barbecue with Jorge and Max from MindsDB and Nixtla, and I was commenting on that experience. To which Jorge promptly replied - why don\u2019t we do it ourselves? So following this discussion, we decided to put the AI in finance event in motion.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-15-the-new-finai-tech-stack_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nAt OpenBB, AI has become a key component in our approach to refactoring the OpenBB Platform from the ground up. We\'ve recently recruited a Head of AI to help us build our strategy and work on this effort full-time.\\n\\nYou can find more details on this [here](/blog/revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-15-the-new-finai-tech-stack_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n## OpenBB x MindsDB\\n\\nA few days later, I visited the MindsDB office to discuss collaborating with Jorge on potential partnerships. I suggested the idea of gaining access to MindsDB\'s data, a proposal that seemed feasible to implement.\\n\\nEventually, we accomplished this, and I even showcased it during the event last week. The code for this endeavour is open source. Take a look [here](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/backend-for-terminal-pro/tree/main/mindsdb_python).\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/bbc1b3c9-2617-46a1-aae6-f41cfd4d3745\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\nHowever, Jorge had an even bigger idea. He proposed the concept of granting MindsDB users access to OpenBB data via SQL and harnessing MindsDB\'s capabilities for machine learning. Essentially, we could convert the data frame in runtime into a virtual SQL table, since we have access to the Pydantic model from the OpenBB platform, and we can build that on the go.\\n\\nAfter [tweeting about this](https://twitter.com/didier_lopes/status/1710560436398264756?s=20), I received numerous messages, which validated that there was interest in OBB SQL. So, we set off to work on this. Together with the OpenBB team, we made it easy to access all available inputs/outputs for each endpoint, while the MindsDB team worked on virtualizing the tables. The result can be seen [here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/openbb_handler).\\n\\nAt the event last week, Jorge shared this work. Additionally, in collaboration with LangChain, he successfully developed a Slack bot with direct access to this data, all accessible within Slack\\n\\n## OpenBB x Nixtla\\n\\nBack in August, Nixtla introduced the initial foundation generative AI model for temporal data at MindsDB. At that time, we received an invitation to showcase the practical applications of TimeGPT in production, and for the first time, we unveiled Terminal Pro briefly.\\n\\nI detailed this experience in a [blog post](https://openbb.co/blog/openbb-incorporates-the-first-generative-AI-model-for-temporal-data-timegpt) and shared a similar demo during the event last week.\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/a8a391c9-33e8-4c6b-821c-620617d4fe33\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\nFollowing that, Max and Azul from Nixtla proceeded to share a presentation where they used OpenBB data to assess price targets from analysts and develop an approach on how it is possible to reduce the bias inherent to price estimates and produce better estimates.\\n\\n## OpenBB x LlamaIndex\\n\\nBack in July, we initiated the development of AskOBB, enabling users to interact with the open source [OpenBB Terminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) using natural language. In this effort, we leveraged LlamaIndex and you can see more about it [here](https://openbb.co/blog/breaking-barriers-with-openbb-and-llamaIndex).\\n\\nSo when we started discussing an AI in Finance event, it only made sense to reach out to Jerry and Simon to invite their team to present at the event. And so we did. Jerry ended up presenting their [open source SEC insights repo](https://github.com/run-llama/sec-insights) that uses the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of LlamaIndex to answer questions about SEC 10-K & 10-Q documents.\\n\\nAs for the OpenBB Terminal Pro, we demonstrated how we are using LlamaIndex to chat with documents that are uploaded to the OpenBB Terminal Pro. The video below highlights these features.\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/3c4190be-2676-4790-a59e-c33c6006a195\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\n## OpenBB x Langchain\\n\\nAfter attending the AI Engineering Summit event, specifically Harrison\u2019s workshop on how to get started with agents using Langchain, I felt inspired to create an agent on top of the OpenBB platform.\\n\\nSo that very day, I went home and started to work on [this repo](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-agents). By the end of the day, the agent was already able to perform complex queries.\\n\\nOver time I iterated on it to make the agent more robust, but the improvement on the architecture started to happen after Michael joined OpenBB and he was able to focus on this full-time - the progress can be found on [this open source repo](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-agents). An example of a prompt that the agent can answer is:\\n\\n> _Check what are TSLA peers. From those, check which one has the highest market cap. Then, on the ticker that has the highest market cap get the most recent price target estimate from an analyst, and tell me who it was and on what date the estimate was made._\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nSo at the event, Harrison presented this architecture which heavily relies on Langchain and OpenBB tools.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-12-15-the-new-finai-tech-stack_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nLater on, I demonstrated how we can integrate this architecture into OpenBB Copilot and make it available from the OpenBB Terminal Pro.\\n\\n<video controls>\\n    <source\\n        src=\\"https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/a3c20953-ca08-4bdd-b7d5-93878edc7e07\\"\\n    />\\n</video>\\n\\n## Wrap up\\n\\nFinally, this was an amazing event organized by MindsDB and a team that put together 5 of the most prominent open-source companies working on problems at the intersection of AI and Finance.\\n\\nYou can rewatch the entire event here:\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1rYmWWVbIY?si=25HUWPxjAB8sfUPx\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nWe\'re considering organizing another event like this soon, possibly even in NYC.\\n\\nAnd if your firm is interested in early access to the OpenBB Terminal Pro, you can reach out to hello@openbb.finance, we\u2019d love to chat."},{"id":"goodbye-openbb-sdk-hello-openbb-platform","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/goodbye-openbb-sdk-hello-openbb-platform","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-11-29-goodbye-openbb-sdk-hello-openbb-platform.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-29-goodbye-openbb-sdk-hello-openbb-platform.md","title":"Goodbye OpenBB SDK.

This is such a milestone for our team and for the financial world that we are renaming the OpenBB SDK into the OpenBB Platform.\\n\\nThe OpenBB Platform consists of the OpenBB Core and OpenBB Extensions.\\n\\nLet\u2019s dive into each of these, individually.\\n\\n## OpenBB Core\\n\\nThe OpenBB Core empowers quants and finance developers to create powerful data solutions, offering unparalleled simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. It follows the principle that \\"less is more.\\"\\n\\nThe core will consist of two main components:\\n\\n1. **Data Standardization Infrastructure:** This ensures that regardless of the type of data processed by the core, users can expect consistent conventions and naming. This facilitates a seamless experience, even when the data comes from completely different data providers.\\n\\n2. **Data Source Integration:** Developers will be able to effortlessly connect and integrate various data sources, including databases, APIs, and cloud storage systems.\\n\\n    a) **Official partner integrations** will be available by having access to official endpoints from data vendors. This ensures the integrity of the data and provides a reference for what data is available to the end user. Our affiliate program will detail where commercial agreements are in place with OpenBB.\\n\\n    b) Additionally, **community provider integrations** will be available, allowing the community to contribute their own integrations for specific use cases or share them with others through the open-source codebase.\\n\\n## OpenBB Extensions\\n\\nOpenBB extensions enhance the capabilities of the OpenBB Core, allowing developers to create custom functionalities and customize the overall Platform according to their specific needs.

Check out our Discord Bot architecture now on GitHub.\\n\\nThe open source code is available [here](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-bot).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\n## What is the OpenBB Bot, and why did we build it?\\n\\nWhen the OpenBB Terminal first went viral, users were writing online that one of the things missing from our product was a chat feature like other investment platforms provide.\\n\\nHowever, we didn\'t understand why the chatting experience needed to be centralized in the application where users research their financial data. Plus, with the ever-growing userbase of apps like Discord, Telegram, Slack, and others, combined with their capabilities to build apps on top, we thought we could do more.\\n\\nWe believe in a future where you can query financial data right from where you are. Meaning you can chat with colleagues, from any of the apps you\'re already using.\\n\\nThis is when we partnered with OptionsFamBot (the biggest Discord financial bot that was present in 15k+ servers, reaching 1 M+ users) to build the OpenBB Bot.\\n\\nYou can read more about our launch in August 2022 [here](https://openbb.co/blog/openbb-bot-launch).\\n\\n## Failing to monetize. Failing to grow user base.\\n\\nTo provide OpenBB Bot users with access to 100+ financial commands (including expensive datasets such as the options and dark pool ones) we had to pay not just the data vendors but also for the display rights.\\n\\nThis was relatively expensive, but we considered it a marketing cost since we expected exponential user growth. We expected that since the Bot could be deployed in any server in a few seconds, more users would be exposed to the Bot, bringing the Bot to other servers, and so on...\\n\\n**However, that didn\'t happen.**\\n\\nIn September 2022, Discord changed its command syntax to force commands to start with \\"/\\" and the user drop was noticeable.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-11-21-openbb-bot-our-new-addition-to-the-openbb-open-source-family_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nIn the meantime, with the end of the Covid-19 Pandemic, people started leaving their houses more and spending less time with communities investing online. Other companies with financial bots were experiencing the same: investors spending less time talking about investing on apps like Discord.\\n\\nWe saw a trend that these same companies started increasing their prices to balance out the number of users.\\n\\nThis is when we went in the other direction: we upgraded our free tier package and decreased the price of our paid version. That announcement can be found [here](https://openbb.co/blog/openbb-bot-price-change).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-11-21-openbb-bot-our-new-addition-to-the-openbb-open-source-family_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThis happened at the same time as we added more innovative features to the bot. Features that OpenBB brought to market, while other bots copied from us today.\\n\\nWe created a codebase that was robust and scalable, but still flexible so that it could be quickly tweaked and deployed on other chatting apps.\\n\\nA couple of days after the price reduction, we announced OpenBB Bot for Telegram (read more about this announcement [here](https://openbb.co/blog/openbb-bot-arrives-on-telegram)).\\n\\nWith the growth of Telegram users and crypto communities, we were well posed to capture that market.\\n\\nOr so we thought. But our growth never achieved the numbers we had initially estimated.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-11-21-openbb-bot-our-new-addition-to-the-openbb-open-source-family_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nOur conclusion is that the market for financial chatbots is much smaller than what we had originally forecasted. This also meant that our goal with the OpenBB Bot as a marketing tool wasn\'t returning the ROI that we were expecting.\\n\\nSo in May 2023 we went pretty much all-in on considering the OpenBB Bot as a marketing expense, and removed the individual paid tier. You can see that announcement [here](https://openbb.co/blog/openbb-bot-free-for-individuals).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-11-21-openbb-bot-our-new-addition-to-the-openbb-open-source-family_4.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nNote that we maintained the control of the Billboard message. This is a feature that allows us to add OpenBB events and announcements to the top of these commands, hence increasing awareness. See below how it looks,\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-11-21-openbb-bot-our-new-addition-to-the-openbb-open-source-family_5.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nHowever, even with that change and [adding an AI feature](https://openbb.co/blog/openbb-midjourney-for-investing) to the OpenBB Bot, the user base never grew past what we had hoped.\\n\\nSo we decided to open source the architecture behind the OpenBB Bot.\\n\\n## Decision to open source\\n\\nWhen talking with Roberto Talamas (check out his [OpenBB champion story](https://openbb.co/blog/openbb-champions-roberto-talamas)), he mentioned that he was building his own financial chatbot for his fund from scratch.\\n\\nThat was the trigger we needed to open source our architecture, so the \\"Robertos\\" of the world wouldn\'t have to start building their chatbot from scratch, but could piggyback on our architecture, which just works (it has never been down since launch and processed over 2.75 M Discord requests).\\n\\nSince we failed to monetize the Bot, and our adoption trajectory never grew past our expectations, open-sourcing the architecture behind the OpenBB Bot made a ton of sense.\\n\\nThis architecture utilizes data from the OpenBB platform (check out last week\'s [beta announcement](https://openbb.co/blog/celebrating-the-openbb-platform-v4-beta)) which means that developers can simultaneously get familiar with our platform while seeing how easy it is to pull financial data from OpenBB - effectively growing OpenBB\'s ecosystem.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-11-21-openbb-bot-our-new-addition-to-the-openbb-open-source-family_6.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nI\'m looking forward to seeing what products are built around the OpenBB Bot in the future.\\n\\nYou can check the repository [here](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-bot).\\n\\nWelcome to the OpenBB open source family."},{"id":"revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-11-07-revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-07-revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig.md","title":"Revolutionizing AI at OpenBB with new leader, Michael Struwig","description":"With the launch of the OpenBB Terminal Pro approaching, we\'re excited to announce the hiring of Michael Struwig, a Ph.D. with expertise in AI and quantitative finance.

With the inception of the OpenBB Terminal Pro, we are standing at the cusp of a significant leap. Our journey began with [AskOBB](https://openbb.co/blog/breaking-barriers-with-openbb-and-llamaIndex), a tool that facilitated natural language interaction with financial data, but that was just the start.\\n\\nLast month, I wrote a [tweet](https://twitter.com/didier_lopes/status/1706731145776566399) explaining why we spent over $500,000 in revamping our core platform. We are committed to creating the best finance platform for quants/analysts to build with. Some key features are:\\n\\n<ul>\\n    <li>We are data vendor agnostic - we enable them</li>\\n    <li>We are open source - everyone can contribute data</li>\\n    <li>We standardize data across close to 100 different data providers</li>\\n    <li>We put a lot of effort into our documentation</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nThese features allow us to bring AI to our platform from the ground up, and think about how that will impact the user experience at the core level.\\n\\nFor instance this is an extension that James added to the OpenBB Platform.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-11-07-revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig_1.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\nThere are a lot of products out there utilizing generative AI for finance. Most of these can be classified as:\\n\\n<ul>\\n    <li>Startups built around a particular feature - e.g. chatting with news. With LLMs becoming a commodity, over time it will be easy to understand that this is a feature and not a product itself.</li>\\n    <li>Larger companies that put a small team together to explore generative AI to be seen as leaders in the space - but without an intention to bring such to market. Often because of outdated tech stack.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nWe are different. The [OpenBB Terminal Pro](https://my.openbb.co/app/pro) is the most customizable investment research platform for teams of quants and analysts. It contains generative AI features, but these are embodied inside the app, and treated as part of the user experience.\\n\\nSome examples below:\\n\\n<li>Summarize news articles in seconds</li>\\n<br />\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-11-07-revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig_2.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<li>Ask more detailed questions to your widgets like earnings transcript or even insider trading</li>\\n<br />\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-11-07-revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig_3.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<li>And more.</li>\\n<br />\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nMost of these generative AI features have been started as side projects by our team members, and once we validated the use case with financial professionals we incorporated it into the roadmap. However, we want to double down on this effort and therefore we\'re excited to welcome [Michael](https://twitter.com/MichaelNStruwig) to OpenBB.\\n\\n[Michael](https://twitter.com/MichaelNStruwig) has a PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, has been doing AI for a few years, and prior to joining us was the CEO of Hudson & Thames Quantitative Research.\\n\\nI first heard him from his reading groups:\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe width=\\"619\\" height=\\"400\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FxMDrHnKWnk\\" title=\\"BloombergGPT: A Large Language Model for Finance\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe width=\\"619\\" height=\\"400\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kX_7ocfTS8g\\" title=\\"FinGPT: Open-Source Financial Large Language Models\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\nFrom watching these videos it was clear that Michael is an expert in the field and was capable of understanding deep topics and not solely staying on the surface. So I was keen to have a chat with him. It turns out that he was a big supporter of OpenBB in particular due to our open-source approach to finance and the connection was immediate.\\n\\nMichael met a few of our team members, and a week later we had a signed contract.\\n\\nI couldn\u2019t be more excited to welcome him to the team and see the amazing products we are going to build at OpenBB.\\n\\nHere\u2019s what Michael has to say about joining OpenBB:\\n\\n> _\\"At OpenBB, I\'ve discovered the perfect blend of my core passions: ML/AI, Opensource, and, more recently, quantitative finance. Joining the OpenBB team truly feels like a fairytale come true. I\'ve never encountered a team so singularly-focused and driven.

But it was built as a second thought (after the Terminal) and it was extremely time-consuming to manage all dependencies.\\n\\nPlus, the SDK had more than just access to data and thus was bloated.\\n\\nSo we invested $500,000 to build it from the ground up and focus on data access.\\n\\nNow the OpenBB Platform (rebrand) is lean and scalable.\\n\\nIt can be used in Python (`pip install openbb==4.0.0a2`) but also for web development.

You may think that this is intuition, but it\u2019s actually the data that you gathered from talking with 100+ users and learning from others in the industry.\\n\\nHowever, people who don\u2019t know your business as well as you do (new joiners, advisors, or investors), don\u2019t understand why your target market is X and not Y. Hence, it\u2019s important to backtrace your \u201cexperience\u201d with data.\\n\\nThis blog post will focus on how you can perform target market analysis for your company. I will provide the framework and the code to leverage OpenAI to speed up that research process. All of this will be replicable, and you can do it for your own company.\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nThis framework is utilized for portfolio analysis in corporate strategy to analyze business units or product lines.\\n\\n### BCG Matrix\\n\\nInitially, BCG implemented its own framework, which you can read more about here. In a nutshell:\\n\\n_It uses two variables: relative market share and the market growth rate. By combining these two variables into a matrix, a corporation can plot their business units accordingly and determine where to allocate extra (financial) resources, where to cash out and where to divest._\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-09-10-target-market-analysis-with-the-help-of-llms_1.png)\\n\\n### GE McKinsey Matrix\\n\\nThen, the GE McKinsey Matrix was invented, which you can read more about here. To put it briefly:\\n\\n_It uses two variables: industry attractiveness and the competitive strength of a business unit. By combining these two variables into a matrix, a corporation can plot their business units accordingly and determine where to invest, where to hold their position, and where to harvest or divest._\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-09-10-target-market-analysis-with-the-help-of-llms_2.png)\\n\\nAs per the blog post, the main difference between these comes from the fact that the latter uses multiple factors that are combined to determine the measure of the two variables: industry attractiveness and competitive strength. Whereas the BCG Matrix only uses 1 variable per axis \u2014 relative market share and market growth rate.\\n\\nThe GE McKinsey Matrix (also known as the Nine-box matrix) has industry attractiveness on the y-axis and competitive strength on the x-axis.\\n\\nFor industry attractiveness, factors to consider can be: Industry size; Long-run growth rate; Industry structure; Industry life cycle; Macro environment; and Market segmentation.\\n\\nFor competitive strength, factors to consider can be: Profitability; Market share; Business growth; Brand equity; Level of differentiation; Firm resources; Efficiency and effectiveness of internal linkages; and Customer loyalty.\\n\\n## How do you build your Matrix?\\n\\nAll the data will be hypothetical. The goal is to share the process and framework. Each company and market will have its own.\\n\\n### 1. Define your factors\\n\\nWhen we talk about market attractiveness, from your company\u2019s perspective, what makes a market attractive? Consider all those factors and list them. Try to list all the factors that have a weight in that equation, but try to keep them under 10; otherwise, it\u2019s too many to have to assess, and at some point, their weight into the attractiveness is negligible.\\n\\nNow do the same for the factors that give your company a competitive advantage.\\n\\n### 2. Weigh each factor\\n  \\nNot all factors are created equal. Some factors will influence whether a market is attractive or not. Similarly, for your competitive advantage, what factors give your company a bigger edge?\\n\\nThe goal is to select a weight for each factor so that the sum of the weights for all the factors adds up to 1. The outcome should look something like:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-09-10-target-market-analysis-with-the-help-of-llms_3.png)\\n\\n### 3. Categorize each factor\\n\\nNow you need to decide how granular you want your assessment to be. Initially, at OpenBB, we started with a scale of 1\u20133 where 1 is low, 2 is medium, and 3 is high. However, soon we found this to not be good enough since there was not enough granularity. Thus, we increased the range from 1 to 5.\\n\\nOnce you decide on that range, you need to categorize it in a way that makes sense for each factor. This ensures that everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to assessing a factor. For instance:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-09-10-target-market-analysis-with-the-help-of-llms_4.png)\\n\\nThis Google / Excel spreadsheet should look like:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-09-10-target-market-analysis-with-the-help-of-llms_5.png)\\n\\n### 4. Select a list of target markets you want to evaluate\\n\\nCreate a new Google spreadsheet / Excel page for each of them. This will allow you to contain all details for each target market on the same page.\\n\\nFor the purposes of this demonstration, we will use \u201cTargetMarket1,\u201d \u201cTargetMarket2,\u201d and \u201cTargetMarket3.\u201d\\n\\n### 5. Assess a target market based on selected factors\\n\\nNow that we have decided on all the factors associated with the target market attractiveness, as well as the competitive advantage, you need to assess each of these based on the target markets that you have selected.\\n\\nEach target market page should look something like this:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-09-10-target-market-analysis-with-the-help-of-llms_6.png)\\n\\nThe factors and weights are automatically pulled from the \u201cFramework page\u201d built previously.\\n\\nHere you just need to set the rating from 1 to 5 (or according to the range you previously specified) based on the evaluation criteria defined. Each of these ratings is multiplied by the weight, and all of those values are summed up together. If your selected range is from 1 to 5, then it means that the minimum and maximum values are 1 and 5, since the weights add up to 1.\\n\\nNote that the last column allows you to add comments based on any additional information/criteria that you used to make a rating choice.\\n\\n### 6. Discover Total Addressable Market\\n\\nOn the spreadsheet above, you may have seen the total addressable market value. I will address how to find this value in a subsequent post.\\n\\nThis is extremely important because even if the market is really attractive, its size can dictate whether to pursue it or not. Most of the time, you don\u2019t want to be chasing a small market opportunity.\\n\\n### 7. Final matrix / chart\\n\\nOnce you have all this data, you can build the following for each of the target markets:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-09-10-target-market-analysis-with-the-help-of-llms_7.png)\\n\\nNote that all you need from each target market is:\\n\\n**Competitive advantage** \u2014 the sum of all the factors and their levels multiplied by their weights gives the x-axis.\\n\\n**Target market attractiveness** \u2014 the sum of all the factors and their levels multiplied by their weights gives the y-axis.\\n\\n**Total Addressable Market (TAM)** \u2014 gives the bubble size on the chart.\\n\\nThen you are ready to make a decision on which market you wish to pursue, and you have data to back it up.\\n\\nNote: There are a lot of assumptions, and you\u2019ll never have it perfect. But with several iterations with your team, you\u2019ll gain more confidence in those assumptions over time, ensuring that you are on the right track and pursuing the right opportunity.\\n\\n## Using OpenAI to bounce ideas to assess a target market\\n\\nSometimes, it can be hard to provide a rating for each of the factors, or it would be better to bounce ideas off someone. This is where you can leverage OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 to help you get started.\\n\\nI built a script that would read from an Excel spreadsheet all the information from the framework page that we have set. That basically means:\\n\\n- All the factors associated with target market attractiveness, and their levels of description\\n- All the factors associated with competitive advantage, and their levels of description\\n\\nThen I prompted GPT-4 to select a level for each of the factors of interest for both attractiveness and competitive advantage, based on what it knows about a specific target market.\\n\\nFor example, let\u2019s say we want to assess the competitive advantage for the target market \u201cHedge Funds\u201d \u2014 this is what the prompt looks like:\\n\\n    We want to assess our competitive advantage based in relation \\n    with factors where we are have an advantage. \\n    \\n    Can you classify those for the following target market: \'Hedge Funds\'\\n    \\n    The factors that we will access this market are presented below: \\n    \\n    When assessing Data Aggregation, these are the rules:\\n    We attribute a value of 5 if We provide all data a market needs\\n    We attribute a value of 4 if We provide most data a market needs\\n    We attribute a value of 3 if We provide some data a market needs\\n    We attribute a value of 2 if We provide very little data a market needs\\n    We attribute a value of 1 if We provide no data a market needs\\n    \\n    When assessing Customization, these are the rules:\\n    We attribute a value of 5 if Market will leverage our open source code\\n    We attribute a value of 4 if Market will fully customize our platform to make it their own\\n    We attribute a value of 3 if Market will customize a bit their platform\\n    We attribute a value of 2 if Market will use platform as is and customize after some time\\n    We attribute a value of 1 if Market will use platform as is\\n    \\n    When assessing Automation, these are the rules:\\n    We attribute a value of 5 if Allows to save more than 70% of time\\n    We attribute a value of 4 if Allows to save 50%-70% of time\\n    We attribute a value of 3 if Allows to save 30%-50% of time\\n    We attribute a value of 2 if Allows to save 15%-30% of time\\n    We attribute a value of 1 if Doesn\'t save any time on automation\\n    \\n    When assessing Factor4, these are the rules:\\n    We attribute a value of 5 if Very high\\n    We attribute a value of 4 if High\\n    We attribute a value of 3 if Medium\\n    We attribute a value of 2 if Low\\n    We attribute a value of 1 if Very low\\n    \\n    When assessing Factor5, these are the rules:\\n    We attribute a value of 5 if Very high\\n    We attribute a value of 4 if High\\n    We attribute a value of 3 if Medium\\n    We attribute a value of 2 if Low\\n    We attribute a value of 1 if Very low\\n    \\n    Given this information, can you return a level for each of the factors \\n    that is our competitive advantage from a viewpoint of Hedge Funds target market.\\n    \\n    Please return it in a json dictionary format with the factor and level only. \\n    Do not add any other text apart from that. \\n    Indent the json with 4 spaces.\\n\\nThen, using the following block of code, we can get OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 to provide its input:\\n\\n```python\\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\\n      model=\\"gpt-4\\",\\n      messages=[\\n            {\\n                \\"role\\": \\"system\\", \\n                 \\"content\\": \\n                    \\"\\"\\"\\n    You are an outstanding financial analyst and were given the task \\n    to perform market research on a possible market segment.\\n    The company succces relies on your accuracy to categorize a \\n    segment and classify according to the factors and levels specified.\\n                    \\"\\"\\"\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\n                 \\"content\\": prompt\\n            },\\n        ]\\n    )\\n    print(response.choices[0].message.content)\\n```\\n\\nThis is what the output looks like:\\n\\n```console\\n    {\\n        \\"Data Aggregation\\": 3,\\n        \\"Customization\\": 4,\\n        \\"Automation\\": 5,\\n        \\"Factor4\\": 2,\\n        \\"Factor5\\": 3\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n**And that\u2019s it for today.**\\n\\nAll of this code is open source and available on my GitHub, here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/target-market-analysis/tree/main\\n\\nI hope you find this insightful, I appreciate any feedback as always."},{"id":"openbb-2-year-anniversary","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/openbb-2-year-anniversary","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-08-20-openbb-2-year-anniversary.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-20-openbb-2-year-anniversary.md","title":"OpenBB 2 year anniversary","description":"Two years of OpenBB.

It will provide a step-by-step guide on the implementation process and include links to relevant spreadsheets that you can use for your own startup.\\n\\nI will continue using the purely fictional example that I introduced in the previous blog post with John Doe.\\n\\nLet\u2019s imagine that John Doe was indeed the right candidate for OpenBB, and on **June 15, 2021**, he was hired and accepted an offer with **2000 options** vesting over the next 4 years with a 1-year cliff. For simplicity, let\u2019s assume that he will vest the 2000 shares by July 1, 2025 (ignoring the additional 2 weeks).\\n\\nThis means that by the end of June 2022, John will have vested 542 shares (13 x 2000 / 48), and for every following month, he will vest 42 shares per month. Note that we only start showing the shares from June 2022 because before that, he was in his cliff period.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-08-09-how-to-handle-equity-top-ups-at-a-seed-stage-startup_1.png)\\n\\nIf you do this calculation, you\u2019ll see that it adds up to 2022, whereas John was only granted 2000 shares. This is normal and is due to rounding, thus the shares associated with the last month are updated so that it matches the offer.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-08-09-how-to-handle-equity-top-ups-at-a-seed-stage-startup_2.png)\\n\\nIf any of the following situations arise:\\n\\n1. The initial assessment of the candidate was wrong, and they are not an IC but a Sr. IC.\\n2. The employee has exceeded expectations, and their equity no longer reflects the value they bring to the company.\\n3. The employee has other job offers, and you want to reinforce that they are an owner of the company and that their success is important.\\n4. The employee\u2019s vesting period is coming to an end, and they are considering leaving as they joined the company for the potential upside of an exit.\\n\\nOne option you have is to increase cash compensation. However, offering equity (ownership) is often a better option, especially for startups with limited cash resources.\\n\\nIn these situations, you need to consider an equity top-up. This means offering the employee a new equity grant on top of the shares they are currently vesting. There are multiple types of equity grants, but I will focus on the approach we use at [OpenBB](https://openbb.co) and explain how you can implement it as well.\\n\\nFirst, determine how many additional shares you want to grant to the individual and, more importantly, how many shares would be fair for them to vest each month. The former helps determine their stake in the company, while the latter helps assess their value compared to other team members.\\n\\nIn our case, let\u2019s assume it\u2019s February 2023, and John has been with the company for 20 months. We want to reward his contributions and bet on his future at the company, so we decide to grant him an additional 1,500 shares on top of his existing 2,000 shares.\\n\\nIn theory, some companies start a new 4-year vesting period with a 1-year cliff for the second grant. However, the issue with that approach is that the employee will start vesting two grants simultaneously: 2000/48 + 1500/48 shares per month. Once the first grant is fully vested, they will vest a lower amount of shares per month: 1500/48. This means the employee would have less incentive to stay when only the second grant is being executed.\\n\\nTo address this, we ensure that for the next 4 years from the vesting commencement date (VCD) of the second grant, the employee vests the same number of shares each month.\\n\\n## How can we do that?\\n\\n### Manual\\n\\nHere is the information we have:\\n\\n- 1st option grant VCD: **15 June 2021**\\n- 1st option grant shares: **2,000**\\n- 1st option grant schedule: **1/48 per month with 1 year cliff finishing on 30 June 2025**\\n\\nFrom here, we infer that in February 2023, John is vesting 42 shares per month and has already vested 542 shares (after the 1-year cliff) + 294 shares (7 x 42).\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s discuss the decisions we need to make for the second option grant:\\n\\n- 2nd option grant VCD: We want to start it ASAP, to retain employee \u2014 for instance **March 2023**\\n- 2nd option grant shares: **around 1,500**\\n- 2nd option grant schedule: **1/48 per month finishing on 30 March 2027**. Note that we removed the cliff since we know the value the employee brings and that \\"protection\\"/\\"retainer\\" can be removed.\\n\\nBy utilizing maths, we can create the following equation:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-08-09-how-to-handle-equity-top-ups-at-a-seed-stage-startup_3.jpeg)\\n\\nBy filling in the information that we know, we get:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-08-09-how-to-handle-equity-top-ups-at-a-seed-stage-startup_4.jpeg)\\n\\nAnd thus we know that we can get the value that makes this happen.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-08-09-how-to-handle-equity-top-ups-at-a-seed-stage-startup_5.jpeg)\\n\\nHowever, we don\u2019t want to give the employee fractional shares each month, so we select a round number around the one that makes him receive around 1,500 additional shares over the course of 4 years.\\n\\nIn this case, that number could be 55. This means that the top-up number would be 13 (55\u201342), except on the last month of vesting for the 1st grant where we need the adjustment.\\n\\nWhen we multiply 55 shares per month for the next 48 months starting in March 2023, that adds up to **2,640**.\\n\\nHowever, the employee was awarded **1,500 shares** (2nd grant) and still has 27 months (from March 2023 to May 2025) to vest 1st grant shares, which corresponds to a total of **1,122 shares** (42 * 26 + 30, remembering the adjustment done for the last month). This total would be **2,622**, which obviously is different from the expected 2,640.\\n\\nTherefore, we update the value of the number of shares given on the 2nd grant so that John receives 55 shares per month. In this case, for that to happen, the 2nd grant has to have a value of 1,573.\\n\\nBut obviously, you don\u2019t need to pick up your calculator every time you do this. I mean, what kind of engineer would I be if I didn\u2019t somehow automate this?\\n\\n### Automated\\n\\nThe spreadsheet below demonstrates what an employee vesting schedule looks like, and below I will write a step-by-step guide so you can fully customize it to your needs.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-08-09-how-to-handle-equity-top-ups-at-a-seed-stage-startup_6.png)\\n\\n- As a result, **E5** will be updated with 11 months afterward to represent the month before the cliff terminates, which consequently leads to the following months being displayed in **column E**.\\n\\n2. Fill in the 1st grant shares in **B5**\\n\\n- As a result, **G6** is updated with the total shares from the 1st grants vested after the 1st year. The following rows in **column G** are automatically updated until the vesting schedule terminates.\\n\\n3. Adjust **G41** so that the sum of shares in **column G** match the shares from the 1st grant in **B5**.\\n\\n4. Fill in the top up grant vesting commencement date (VCD) in **C6**\\n\\n- As a result, **column H** will automatically get populated based on the value that, when added with the cells in **column G**, returns the value in cell **B19**.\\n\\n- This will also allow us to compute the months that have already been vested from the initial shares in **B11** and consequently calculate the overlap between shares coming from the 1st and 2nd grant in **B12**.\\n\\n5. Fill in the top-up grant shares that you are thinking about offering to the employee in **B6**.\\n\\n- As a result, the same computations that were explained earlier in theory will occur. This will result in a recommendation for the top-up shares in **B15** and consequently the amount of shares that the employee will vest monthly in **B16** so that the amount of top-up grant shares is met.\\n\\n6. It is very likely that the number in **B16** will not be rounded. Hence, we fill **B19** with a rounded version of that number.\\n\\n- As a result, **column H** will be updated so that the total shares (from both grants) in **column F** matches the selected value in **B19**.\\n\\nWhen looking at the total top-up shares in **H67**, that value will no longer match the total top-up shares that we wanted to grant to the employee and that we decided at the beginning in **B6**. This is because we rounded the value and thus impacted the number of shares necessary to achieve that.\\n\\nThe amount of shares needed to update the recommendation in **B16** to the rounded version in **B19** is displayed as an \\"error\\" in **B21**.\\n\\n7. In order to fix that, we simply need to update B6 with the sum of B6 and the error value from B21.\\n\\n- As a result of this, all the values should now match, and the combined total amount of shares given to the employee in **B8** should match the sum of the shares spread across dates in **F67**. Plus, the error should now be null in cell **B21**.\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s it.\\n\\nI hope you found this useful and are able to use it internally to share with your employees so they understand how the top-ups happen at your startup.\\n\\nIf you want access to this Excel template, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or LinkedIn."},{"id":"how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-08-03-how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-03-how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley.md","title":"How to handle equity at a seed-stage startup from Silicon Valley","description":"A step-by-step guide on how to handle equity at a seed-stage startup, using a fictional example from OpenBB.","date":"2023-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"startup","permalink":"/blog/tags/startup"},{"inline":true,"label":"equity","permalink":"/blog/tags/equity"},{"inline":true,"label":"silicon-valley","permalink":"/blog/tags/silicon-valley"},{"inline":true,"label":"seed-stage","permalink":"/blog/tags/seed-stage"},{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"}],"readingTime":6.18,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley","title":"How to handle equity at a seed-stage startup from Silicon Valley","date":"2023-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2023-08-03-how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley.png","tags":["startup","equity","silicon-valley","seed-stage","openbb"],"description":"A step-by-step guide on how to handle equity at a seed-stage startup, using a fictional example from OpenBB."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to handle equity top-ups at a seed stage startup","permalink":"/blog/how-to-handle-equity-top-ups-at-a-seed-stage-startup"},"nextItem":{"title":"Keep track of your startup metrics using a custom iOS widget","permalink":"/blog/keep-track-of-your-startup-metrics-using-a-custom-ios-widget"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-08-03-how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nA step-by-step guide on how to handle equity at a seed-stage startup, using a fictional example from OpenBB.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nAs a startup founder and CEO, you need to wear multiple hats, from engineering and product to design, marketing, and even finance.\\n\\nToday, I\u2019m going through the details of how we handle equity at OpenBB. This blog post provides a step-by-step guide on the implementation process, including links to relevant spreadsheets that you can reuse for your startup.\\n\\nTo make this post easier to follow, I will create a purely fictional example.\\n\\nJohn Doe, a software engineer from Portugal, has been contributing to the [open source OpenBB Terminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) for a few consecutive weeks. He not only fixes bugs but also adds features that the community has requested through pull requests and on Discord. Additionally, he is a fast learner and gets along well with the current team. This sparks the interest of the OpenBB team because having this open-source contributor work with us full-time would be great, rather than being limited by his current full-time job.\\n\\nFrom here, we set up an initial exploratory call to better understand John Doe as an individual \u2014 what he is passionate about, why he has contributed to the project, and more. We follow up the call with an interview involving engineers to assess his skills and experience. Finally, he joins a call with me, where I sell the vision of the company and explain why what OpenBB is doing matters. At this point, we extend him an offer. Up until this stage, the recruiting process is standard, except for the fact that we have a \u201cfiltered\u201d candidate coming from the open-source community.\\n\\nHowever, as a startup, that offer cannot (or at least should not) consist solely of cash compensation. A startup [operates at a much faster pace](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) and is riskier than a company. Therefore, in exchange for hard work and long hours, you should offer part of the company through equity, allowing the employee to benefit from the upside in case the company achieves a successful exit (IPO or sale).\\n\\nSo, how do we decide on the equity to offer the new hire?\\n\\nIt\u2019s easy. You follow your company Option Guidelines.\\n\\n## Option Guidelines\\n\\nThe Option Guidelines are an Excel spreadsheet approved by the board. In this document, you explicitly create **bands (minimum and maximum range options)** based on the role and stage of the company. Board approval is crucial as it allows you to extend the offer directly without needing permission from the board since the guidelines have already been approved.\\n\\nHere\u2019s what the document looks like:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-08-03-how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley_1.png)\\nThe total number of shares is random and not representative of OpenBB.\\n\\nFirst, you need to ask yourself what roles your company envisions needing. Within those roles, there are two things to consider:\\n\\n- **Departments:** You may differentiate between Engineering, Marketing, Operations, Sales, Finance, and HR/Admin. You can also add others such as Design, Product, etc. Note that having different departments does not necessarily mean you need different band structures.\\n\\n- **Titles:** You\u2019ll want to be able to \u201ccompare\u201d individuals based on their contributions. For instance, Vice President, Director, Manager, Senior Individual Contributor, and Individual Contributor. Note that if you have fewer titles, the bands should be wider to differentiate individuals with the same title. If you add five levels of Individual Contributors, you\u2019ll want narrower bands.\\n\\n  I recommend starting with fewer titles, KISS: keep it simple stupid. Again, having different levels does not necessarily mean the bands need to be mutually exclusive. A Manager does not necessarily have a higher band than a Senior Individual Contributor; this depends on your own company culture.\\n\\nNext, you need to differentiate between **company stages**. This allows you to distinguish employees who join very early when the startup carries the most risk. We distinguish between three stages: Pre-production revenue, Pre-profit with production revenue, and Profitable.\\n\\nOnce all these categories are completed, you should have a similar table to the one shared above. Now, it\u2019s important to fill in the equity percentage. For privacy reasons, I will not provide the specific values for OpenBB but will create a random example.\\n\\nLet\u2019s imagine that OpenBB Charter has a total of 1 million shares (assuming only one class of stock for simplicity). If our priced round values the company at $10 million, this means that each share is valued at $10.\\n\\nOn the top left of the document, we will insert the number of shares, which is 1,000,000. Then, we adjust the % LOW and % HIGH columns, representing the range of company ownership we want to grant to this individual.\\n\\nLet\u2019s go through a fake example for the SW role:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-08-03-how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley_2.png)\\n\\nThe column \u201cLow Shrs\u201d is computed by multiplying the % LOW by the total number of shares. On the other hand, the column \u201cHigh Shrs\u201d is computed by multiplying the % HIGH by the total number of shares. This value is important as it represents the amount stipulated in the contract.\\n\\nLet\u2019s consider a scenario where the company is in the Pre-Profit stage with Production Revenue, and we want to hire an Engineering IC. Based on our assessment of their skillset and fairness in comparison to other team members, we would offer a contract that vests over time between 1000 and 2000 shares.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-08-03-how-to-handle-equity-at-a-seed-stage-startup-from-silicon-valley_3.png)\\n\\nNext, you need to decide on the vesting calendar that the company supports. The most common option is a 4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff. This means that while you begin vesting during your first year, you need to stay with the company for the entire year to be able to exercise those options. The 1-year cliff protects the company from employees leaving early or underperforming.\\n\\nCarta provides a good explanation on how stock options work [here](https://carta.com/blog/equity-101-stock-option-basics/) \u2014 which I recommend to everyone.\\n\\nPlease note that in theory, while the value of these options is $10 per share, the startup will need to conduct a 409a valuation to determine the fair market value of each option, which is likely to be much lower than the initial price, such as $1 per share. And this is the strike price that employees will need to pay to exercise the shares.\\n\\nNote: when selecting the number of shares, use a number that is divisible by the number of months that the employee is vesting, e.g., for a 4-year vesting period that would be 48 (4 x 12), which ensures that employees get the same amount of shares each month, and there\u2019s no need to account for floating numbers.\\n\\nThis is it for today.\\n\\nIn Part II, I will talk about how you can handle equity top-ups.\\n\\nSo follow me if you want to learn more about what that process may look like."},{"id":"keep-track-of-your-startup-metrics-using-a-custom-ios-widget","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/keep-track-of-your-startup-metrics-using-a-custom-ios-widget","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-07-29-keep-track-of-your-startup-metrics-using-a-custom-ios-widget.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-29-keep-track-of-your-startup-metrics-using-a-custom-ios-widget.md","title":"Keep track of your startup metrics using a custom iOS widget","description":"Keep track of your startup metrics using a custom iOS widget.

Whether that is MRR, number of customers, GitHub stars, AUM, .. depends on the type and stage of company, and what you are optimizing for.\\n\\nAt [OpenBB](https://openbb.co) we are currently optimizing for [OpenBB Hub](https://my.openbb.co) users, since this is the place where you have access to our entire suite of products. From [OpenBB Terminal](https://my.openbb.co/app/terminal), [OpenBB SDK](https://my.openbb.co/app/sdk), [OpenBB Bot](https://my.openbb.co/app/bot) and soon \u2014 the highly awaited [OpenBB Terminal Pro](https://my.openbb.co/app/pro).\\n\\nSo everyday I spent some time checking our startup [/open page](https://openbb.co/open). However, whenever I had to check these on mobile I had to open up the browser, type the link and then look for the metric of interest.\\n\\nHence, to save time, I built a custom iOS widget that displays these metrics of interest at all times.

It covers the motivation behind the project, the requirements, and the implementation process, including the use of the Slack API and Airtable API for automation.\\n\\nThe open source code is available [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/insights-from-team-survey).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\n## Motivation\\n\\nI\u2019ve been wanting to play with the OpenAI API for a while, but I\u2019ve had higher priority tasks. Yesterday, I thought that I could use the day to do this, but I didn\u2019t want to just try it in a notebook. Instead, I wanted to use it in a real project that could save me time.\\n\\nLast week, I posted about how at OpenBB we have developed a monthly team survey and automated the process of requesting information through Slack and Airtable. You can find more on that post [here](/blog/employees-are-leaving-be-proactive-about-employee-feedback).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-21-how-to-use-openai-to-extract-insights-from-team-survey_1.png)\\n\\nThis made me think that even though I have access to all this data, which OpenBB has made fully available [here](https://openbb.co/open), I still have to spend some time looking at the data to extract insights.\\n\\n<img width=\\"1397\\" alt=\\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 4 39 41 PM\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-07-21-how-to-use-openai-to-extract-insights-from-team-survey_2.png\\" />\\n\\nWhat if I could automate that analysis using OpenAI? This is what I set out to build, and this post will focus on how I went from idea to implementation.\\n\\n## Requirements\\n\\nI already had a notebook that I used to analyze our Airtable data with our team survey in it. However, that analysis was quite \u201cheavy,\u201d and it was not straightforward to extract insights. Thus, one of the requirements was to use OpenAI to analyze the team survey feedback for the current month and highlight anything worth mentioning.\\n\\nAdditionally, I wanted to compare the team\u2019s experience to the prior month to understand if we were improving or not, and identify areas for further improvement. Finally, based on these insights, I wanted OpenAI to suggest what OpenBB, as a company, could do to improve our culture.\\n\\nTo achieve this using an OpenAI model, I could either export the team survey responses from Airtable in CSV and copy-paste them into ChatGPT, or I could automate the data retrieval using the Airtable API. Being an engineer, why would I do something in 5 minutes when I can spend 1 day automating it? \ud83e\udd23\\n\\nLastly, I didn\u2019t want to run this script and have to copy-paste the output into our Slack group so that everyone on the team could have access to the overall analysis and provide feedback/suggestions. Therefore, I would like to have a Slack integration that sends the output in a specific formatted way to our Slack channel.\\n\\nSo, the idea is as follows:\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li>Retrieve team feedback responses from Airtable</li>\\n    <li>Extract insights from the team survey data using OpenAI</li>\\n    <li>Send the insights output to the OpenBB Slack channel</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n## Implementation\\n\\n### Slack API\\n\\nFirst of all, I went to the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps) page. There, I created an app named \u201cEmployee Voice\u201d and selected the \u201cOpenBB\u201d workspace, as shown below:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-21-how-to-use-openai-to-extract-insights-from-team-survey_3.png)\\n\\nAfter clicking \u201cCreate App\u201d I proceeded to update the display information.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-21-how-to-use-openai-to-extract-insights-from-team-survey_4.png)\\n\\nThen I go into \u201cIncoming Webhooks\u201d and select the channel I\u2019m interested in posting messages to. That should be all the settings you need to configure for your app.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-21-how-to-use-openai-to-extract-insights-from-team-survey_5.png)\\n\\nThe webhook URL will be necessary, so I copied it and added it to the following script. For the channel name, I used my personal name, \u201c_Didier Lopes_\u201d, since I was just testing if it worked. As for the message, I used the infamous \u201cHello World\u201d text.\\n\\nHere is a sample that you can use to test whether you can successfully send yourself a direct message using the Slack API.\\n\\n```python\\n    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=<Webhook URL mentioned above>\\n    \\n    insight=\\"Hello World\\"\\n    \\n    payload = {\\n        \'text\': insight,\\n    }\\n    \\n    req = Request(SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, json.dumps(payload).encode(\'utf-8\'))\\n    try:\\n        response = urlopen(req)\\n        response.read()\\n        \\n        print(\\"SUCCESS: Message with insights sent to slack\\\\n\\")\\n    except HTTPError as e:\\n        print(f\\"Request failed: {e.code} {e.reason}\\\\n\\")\\n    except URLError as e:\\n        print(f\\"Server connection failed: {e.reason}\\\\n\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Airtable API\\n\\nAt OpenBB, we are using Airtable to automate the monthly team survey questionnaire and store the associated data. I wrote more about that process in [this blog](/blog/employees-are-leaving-be-proactive-about-employee-feedback).\\n\\nNow, I want to have programmatic access to this data.\\n\\nFirstly, I need to obtain the Airtable API key, which you can get from the [Airtable Developer Hub](https://airtable.com/create/tokens). Secondly, I navigate to Airtable and locate the table that contains the data of interest, as shown below:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-21-how-to-use-openai-to-extract-insights-from-team-survey_6.png)\\n\\nThe name of the table, \u201c_OpenBB_monthly_\u201d, corresponds to the \u201cTABLE NAME\u201d that will be necessary. Additionally, when you are on this table view, your URL will have the following format: https://airtable.com/XXX. That XXX is your \u201cBASE ID,\u201d which will be the final element necessary to retrieve data from Airtable.\\n\\nNext, run the following script to ensure that you have access to this data.\\n\\n```python\\n    AIRTABLE_API_KEY=<Located in Airtable Developer Hub>\\n    AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=<Located in URL when accessing data>\\n    AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=\\"OpenBB_monthly\\"\\n    \\n    response = requests.get(\\n        url=f\'https://api.airtable.com/v0/{AIRTABLE_BASE_ID}/{AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME}\',\\n        headers={\'Authorization\': f\'Bearer {AIRTABLE_API_KEY}\'}\\n    )\\n    \\n    Check if the data has been loaded correctly\\n    if response.status_code == 200:\\n        data = response.json()[\\"records\\"]\\n    else:\\n        print(f\\"Error: {response.status_code}\\")\\n    \\n    print(data)\\n```\\n\\n### OpenAI API\\n\\nFinally, go to [OpenAI Developer platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and grab your OpenAI API key.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-21-how-to-use-openai-to-extract-insights-from-team-survey_7.png)\\n\\nOnce you have that, you are pretty much ready to test whether this works or not. In this case, we assume you have access to the data from Airtable, so you can test if the OpenAI code is set up correctly with the following:\\n\\n```python\\n    data_previous_month=<dataframe with raw survey data from previous month>\\n    data_current_month=<dataframe with raw survey data from current month>\\n    current_month=<current month date>\\n    \\n    openai.api_key=<Located in OpenAI Developer platform>\\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\\n    model=\\"gpt-4\\",  # you can use a different model\\n    messages=[\\n            {\\"role\\": \\"system\\", \\"content\\": \\"You are a Chief of Staff with a MSc. in Data analysis and are trying to improve the culture of the company.\\"},\\n            {\\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\n            \\"content\\": \\n                f\\"\\"\\"\\n        This table represents the company survey for the previous month: {data_previous_month}\\n    \\n        This table represents the company survey for this month: {data_current_month}.\\n    \\n        Based on this data, can you do 3 things:\\n        \\n        1. Summarize main differences since last month\\n        2. Summarize main highlights for current month\\n        3. Create suggestions for what could be done to improve those areas\\n        \\n        Please use the following format for the output:\\n            As the title use the following: Insights from team survey in {current_month}.\\n            Follow the title by 2 line breaks.\\n            Use bullet points within each of the points mentioned above.\\n            Between the 3 points, use 1 line breaks, a line with ----------------------- and another line break.\\n            Use `` when referring to a component like `Reward` or `Growth`.\\n            Do not use asterisks \'*\' or \'**\'.\\n            When referring to to Engineering or Product, Marketing, Design, Finance wrap them around asterisk, e.g. _Engineering_.\\n                \\"\\"\\"\\n            },\\n        ]\\n    )\\n    \\n    print(response.choices[0].message.content)\\n```\\n\\n## Glue it together\\n\\nOnce you have the scripts, merging them is straightforward. I will show you what the input vs. output looks like.\\n\\nHere is [OpenBB](http://openbb.co/)\u2019s team survey data from June of 2023:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-21-how-to-use-openai-to-extract-insights-from-team-survey_8.png)\\n\\nIf I run the script here, as shown below (yes, you guessed it right \u2014 I open-sourced this project as usual. I hope you and your team find it useful):\\n\\n```console\\n    $ python extract_insights_from_last_team_survey.py\\n```\\n\\nThis is the expected output if the script runs successfully.\\n\\n```console\\n    Loading environment variables...\\n    Loading team survey data from Airtable...\\n    Processing data from Airtable...\\n    Extracting insights from team survey data...\\n    Sending insights to Slack through a message...\\n    SUCCESS: Message with insights sent to slack\\n```\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-21-how-to-use-openai-to-extract-insights-from-team-survey_9.png)\\n\\n## Automate with GitHub workflow\\n\\nWe\u2019re almost there! It doesn\u2019t make sense for us to manually run this script every month. Plus, software engineers are known for their laziness (which is actually a [virtue of a great programmer](https://thethreevirtues.com/)), so let\u2019s create a GitHub action to automate this process.\\n\\nTo begin, create a file called \u201cmain.yml\u201d in the \u201c.github/workflows\u201d directory.\\n\\n[This workflow](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/insights-from-team-survey/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) will be divided into three main sections:\\n\\n### When\\n\\nSpecifies when this GitHub action should run.\\n\\n```console\\n    on:\\n      push:\\n        branches:\\n          - main\\n      schedule:\\n        - cron: \'0 0 3 * *\'\\n```\\n\\nThe first section, \u201con: push: branches: [main]\u201d means that whenever there is a code push to the \u201cmain\u201d branch, this workflow will be triggered.

This post explores why open source is crucial for us and the main problems in the space.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nHaving a closed source OpenBB Terminal was never on the table.\\n\\nThe [OpenBB Terminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) is the platform it is today due to its open source nature. Launched almost 2.5 years ago, the interest on this platform was clear \u2014 aggregating an impressive 4000 stars on GitHub in under 24 hours from launch.\\n\\nThis number kept on growing along with the community (most of which gathers on [our Discord server](http://openbb.co/discord)) and allowed us to create the company OpenBB, see the story [here](http://openbb.co/blog/gme-didnt-take-me-to-the-moon-but-gamestonk-terminal-did).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-16-why-the-need-for-an-open-source-investment-research-platform_1.png)\\n\\nBut why is open source so important for us? To understand this, it\u2019s important for us go over the main problems in the space.\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li>Data licensing</li>\\n    <li>Full-price bundle</li>\\n    <li>Transparency and customization</li>\\n    <li>Community</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n## Data licensing\\n\\nCurrent monopolies spend an enormous amount of capital on financial data licensing. There are dozens of different asset classes (equities, options, crypto, NFTs, forex, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, \u2026) and these often vary based on geography. In addition, alternative datasets have grown a lot in popularity as they can provide a hedge in the market (e.g. a hurricane can impact orange juice futures).\\n\\nThat makes the overall investment research industry a very tough market to compete. Startups cannot disrupt the space without a massive capital injection. Explaining why the data offered by startups usually focuses on a certain asset class, in a certain geography.\\n\\nThis is why OpenBB doesn\u2019t own the data (similar to Uber not owning cars, Airbnb not owning apartments, Deliveroo not owning restaurants). OpenBB wants to be the infrastructure layer between data sources and users.\\n\\nThis is the typical two-sided market, where on the one hand users benefit from having access to multiple datasets in one place, and on the other hand data sources benefit from having users on our platform as they can monetize their data. This allows us to focus on the product while our number of data integrations and users grows.\\n\\n## Full-price bundle\\n\\nCurrent incumbents pricing is usually a complete bundled offering. This means that regardless of what you are utilizing in terms of both breadth and depth, you pay the full price tag. A good analogy is like a restaurant ONLY having a buffet when all you want is a bottle of water, or some chips.\\n\\nWhat happens is that a user ends up paying for data that they are not using. In 2023, this is a very outdated take. Companies are looking to get leaner, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to pay for data that you aren\u2019t leveraging.\\n\\nBeing the infrastructure between users and data sources allows you to create value to both. Users will have access to all the data they want and pay for the ones they use, and data sources will have access to a big pool of users.\\n\\nIn addition some data providers (e.g. a team of machine learning engineers) will not need to create a dashboard for their users to visualize their data and hire a team to start a sales/marketing motion, as they will be able to rely on OpenBB\u2019s infrastructure.\\n\\n## Transparency and customization\\n\\nCurrent incumbents have built several in-house financial models. Although these are often customizable, their customization is typically limited. That is because what is usually customizable are the values/weights, but not necessarily the formulas \u2014 that is kept hidden in their source code. This is an issue because that code cannot be validated and users cannot modify it.\\n\\nWith open source, the story is completely different. Users can see every single line of code and therefore, not only audit the code quality but adapt the models/formulas to their own needs. At the end of the day, there is no point in re-inventing the wheel for financial theory that has been around for decades.\\n\\nBy having the code open source, users can rely on the fact that these formulas have been validated/tested by thousands or millions of users and therefore, there\u2019s a very low chance that these are wrong. In addition, users are more secure because they can investigate the code and check/fix any vulnerabilities.\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nOne of the best parts of open source is the integrated community that it creates. This attracts people from every background, gender or ethnicity. Such a pool of diversity allows for better ideas and pushes a project further. With people from the community being able to contribute, this also drives innovation.\\n\\nOpenBB has been driven a lot by the community so far. What started as a terminal mostly focused on equities, soon evolved into including a broad range of datasets and considering several geographies. For instance: A contributor from Sweeden integrated Avanza API to the mutual funds menu that would only appear if users were looking into mutual funds from Sweden \u2014 this shows the power of community.\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-07-16-why-the-need-for-an-open-source-investment-research-platform_2.png)\\n\\nWe are close to 23,000 stars.

As this phrase can often be interpreted differently, here\'s the standard definition that ChatGPT gave me:\\n\\n> _\\"An open startup is a company that practices open innovation and transparent communication with its stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors. This means that the company is willing to share information about its products, services, and business operations with the public and is open to input and feedback from all stakeholders._\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n> _Open startups typically have a strong focus on collaboration and community building, and they often use open source technology and principles in their operations. Some open startups may also be structured as cooperative or worker-owned enterprises, in which ownership and decision-making power are shared among employees.\u201d_\\n\\n## Why now?\\n\\nI\'ve been learning about the open startup movement for a while now and I always knew that I wanted OpenBB to follow this trend. At the end of the day, I want us to accelerate the openness and transparency in the financial world.\\n\\nBut until recently, this wasn\'t one of our top priorities. This all changed when the cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed. This was a house of cards and they stood for everything but transparency \u2014 not only with their users but also with their shareholders and team alike!\\n\\nJohn J. Ray III who has spent a career tackling large corporate failures involving allegations of criminal activity (like Enron), was appointed CEO of FTX to deal with the bankruptcy, and this is one of his quotes to the US congress:\\n\\n> _\\"Never in my career have I seen such an utter failure of corporate controls at every level of an organization, from the lack of financial statements to a complete failure of any internal controls or governance whatsoever\\"_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nOpenBB wants to pave the way of transparency in the financial world.\\n\\n## Why open?\\n\\n### Transparency\\n\\nTransparency across team, shareholders, users and new hires is key. Everyone can see our growth in the same location; A single source of truth accessible to everyone at all times. We already have our code open source, which shows transparency in our engineering, so it only makes sense for us to behave in the same way with our business.\\n\\n### Accountability\\n\\nEveryone will know how we\'re doing, for better or worse. This will make us feel responsible to show accurate sustainable growth as this information becomes public. Since everyone has equity in the company, this will be our own skin in the game.\\n\\nWhen people ask, \\"How is OpenBB going?\\" this can be answered with a single link to our open page.\\n\\n### Community building\\n\\nEvery company is trying to build a community these days, but building a community is hard. By having all of our information publicly available, anyone from the community will know how we are doing at all times \u2014 similar to what the team, shareholders and investors know.\\n\\nThis helps to build trust in OpenBB and allow us to attract and retain talented employees who value transparency and an open culture.\\n\\n### Marketing\\n\\nUsers will be able to share our open page to share OpenBB metrics with other users, which will help to increase awareness for us.\\n\\nIn addition, we want to become leaders of open culture in the financial world, which is known for being a very closed industry. We want to influence companies in this sector and start a movement.\\n\\n### Fundraising\\n\\nSince starting OpenBB, I\'ve met well over 50 different investors, even without actively fundraising. Whilst this is a great way to start relationships, it\'s not sustainable as it takes valuable time away from talking with users/customers (and let\'s be honest, even developing :slight_smile:). So by having an open page, we will be able to discuss our growth async and more efficiently. And then, when we are actively fundraising, we can focus on the details.\\n\\n## How will it be done?\\n\\nWe are adding all our metrics and stats to [/open](https://openbb.co/open).\\n\\nOur open metrics will contain 4 main distinct sections to start with:\\n\\n#### Social Media metrics\\n\\nTwitter followers, Discord users, LinkedIn followers, YouTube views, Reddit followers. Allows to understand the strength of our community in the social media channels that we focus on.\\n\\n#### Team stats\\n\\nTeam distribution and employee engagement coming soon. Allows to understand where we are based and employee experience at OpenBB\\n\\n#### Product metrics\\n\\nOpenBB Hub users, OpenBB Bot, OpenBB SDK and OpenBB Terminal. Allows to hold us accountable for our user growth and the usage that our products have\\n\\n#### Developer metrics\\n\\nStars, forks, merged pull-requests, closed issues, contributors. Keep up-to-date with our development speed and how engaged the open source community is.\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nFor all the metrics that are open source, there will be an \u24d8 in the top right to share information on why this chart was made open source and why it\'s important to us.\\n\\nOnce a metric is open, we do not intend to close it ever again, that is why all the metrics we are making public have gone through a thorough reasoning process and there\'s enough contextual information to understand its meaning.\\n\\nIf you can think of a metric that you would like to see on our open page, please feel free to DM me."},{"id":"employees-are-leaving-be-proactive-about-employee-feedback","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/employees-are-leaving-be-proactive-about-employee-feedback","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-06-29-employees-are-leaving-be-proactive-about-employee-feedback.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-29-employees-are-leaving-be-proactive-about-employee-feedback.md","title":"Employees are leaving?

Be proactive about employee feedback. This blogpost discusses the importance of employee feedback and how we at OpenBB are ensuring high employee engagement through a periodic feedback survey.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nThis blogpost shows the measures we are taking to ensure we have high employee engagement at OpenBB through a periodic feedback survey.\\n\\nWhen we started OpenBB, I was absolutely obsessed about our product. All my focus and time was dedicated to building our suite of products (OpenBB Terminal, OpenBB SDK or OpenBB Bot), or talking about these with our users. I care deeply about the OpenBB team, but I expected everyone to be as motivated as me, 24/7.\\n\\nBut things just don\u2019t work that way. Although we always have a fun quarterly event online, that isn\u2019t enough. Everyone knows that I\u2019m a big fan of remote work, but one clear down side of it is the lack of contact and face to face conversations which makes employee engagement more volatile. I say this, because I believe that when your team is together in the same space, it\u2019s easier to thrive off each others excitement and motivation.\\n\\nSoon enough, I realized that _\u201calone you can go faster, but with a team you can go far\u201d_. This is when I started putting time into understanding what we could be doing better to improve our work culture.\\n\\nSome things that we have now put into place include:\\n\\n- We updated the company values as a team, based on what we currently had that they were proud of and where they would like us to be in the future. In a startup, where the pace is incredibly fast and the team is constantly changing, I strongly believe that the values change over time too.\\n\\n- We had an [OpenBB rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=48&v=ThtSC8s0h6I&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fopenbb.co%2Fblog&source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjg2NjMsMjg2NjY&ab_channel=OpenBB) made by a freestyler for our OpenBB Christmas event.\\n\\n- We started pushing for more transparency. We were already very transparent internally, but now we started to push this value externally too. Everyone in the company has skin in the game, this allows the team to feel as accountable for the metrics as I do. I wrote more about this in this blogpost: [From open source to open startup](/blog/from-open-source-to-open-startup), and I am currently working on the OpenBB Handbook too.\\n\\n- I started having office hours, where I can spend the time with the team chatting about anything (product, strategy, engineering, storytelling, even fundraising). The team knows that I\u2019m usually available, but having that 1 hour blocked gives them the confidence to know that that time booked in the day.\\n\\nHowever, there was something critical missing. I will explain what it is by using what I learned at university (that way I can say that my MSc in Control Systems was indeed useful for OpenBB \ud83d\ude43).\\n\\nWhat we had built is an open loop control system, and it looks something like this:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-06-29-employees-are-leaving-be-proactive-about-employee-feedback_1.png)\\n\\nThe problem? open loop systems can be inaccurate and unreliable. More importantly, because there is no feedback mechanism to correct inputs as the controller (leadership) never gets the information that comes out of the system (team engagement).\\n\\nThe key word here is feedback. An office hour session is great, but it\u2019s a poor \u201csensor device\u201d. The reason being that you are opening the door for the team to communicate with you, but that data isn\u2019t significant to extrapolate through the whole team.\\n\\nWe needed feedback. We needed to have a closed-loop system instead of an open one. By that I mean:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-06-29-employees-are-leaving-be-proactive-about-employee-feedback_2.png)\\n\\nThis allows us to constantly monitor our team happiness, and be able to react when the feedback doesn\u2019t match our desired culture.\\n\\nBut what is this feedback? What do we want to track? We didn\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, so we looked up to how the best companies do it. In particular, we studied \u201cThe Psychology of Employee Engagement\u201d e-book from Workday written by Phillip Chambers.\\n\\nThis allowed us to come up with the following survey, where the team would reply anonymously to each of the questions with a rating from 1 to 10 where 1 corresponds to \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d and 10 corresponds to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d.\\n\\n- **Accomplishment:** I feel a regular sense of accomplishment\\n- **Autonomy:** I feel that I am given autonomy in the way I complete my tasks\\n- **Meetings:** I feel that I have a good amount of meetings every week. (this question was originally about environment, but due to our remote nature we felt that the amount of meetings was something more important to measure)\\n- **Freedom of Opinions:** I feel that I have a voice in the company and my opinion matters\\n- **Goal Setting:** I feel that both my goals and expectations are set clearly\\n- **Growth:** I feel that I have opportunities to grow professionally\\n- **Management Support:** I feel that my manager cares for me and empowers me\\n- **Meaningful Work:** I feel that my work matters\\n- **Organizational Fit:** I feel like the company values align with mine and we share the same goal\\n- **Peer relationships:** I feel connected with my colleagues and that I can be myself with them\\n- **Recognition:** I feel like I get recognized for my contributions\\n- **Reward:** I feel like I am rewarded fairly for my work\\n- **Strategy:** I feel like the company strategy is being communicated effectively\\n- **Workload:** I feel like I can manage my workload efficiently\\n\\nNow you may be wondering how we made this survey completely automated, the workflow is actually very straightforward and we were able to automate it. Here is what it looks like: Airtable + Slack \u2705\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-06-29-employees-are-leaving-be-proactive-about-employee-feedback_3.png)\\n\\nEven though our salaries don\u2019t compete with the MAMAAs of this world, we believe that: our mission, our innovative products and unique culture are what makes us OpenBB. And why we can retain our talent.\\n\\nYou can find our employee engagement index at: https://openbb.co/company/open/team"},{"id":"hybrid-work-sucks-its-worse-than-remote-and-office","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hybrid-work-sucks-its-worse-than-remote-and-office","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-06-12-hybrid-work-sucks-its-worse-than-remote-and-office.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-12-hybrid-work-sucks-its-worse-than-remote-and-office.md","title":"Hybrid work sucks.

This blog post discusses the pros and cons of remote and office work, and why hybrid work might not be the best solution.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nThis is my hot take for 2023, but bear with me.\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nEveryone on Twitter has been actively discussing that \u201cRemote work failed\u201d, e.g. [this tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1663958149437743105?s=20) from David Sacks where he refers to [this blogpost](https://flocrivello.com/changing-my-mind-on-remote-about-being-in-san-francisco/), or [this tweet](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1667580108247277570?s=20) from Paul Graham.\\n\\nWhile I\u2019m not going to pose as an expert on the topic, I feel like I\u2019ve experienced enough to have an opinion. My career so far has been:\\n\\n- 1 year of office work for a public company\\n- 1 year of remote work for a startup, plus a few months of hybrid work for the same startup\\n- 2 years of growing [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/) from 1 to 20 people, all fully remote.\\n\\nLet me first go over the advantages and disadvantages of remote and office work, so that I can focus this blog post on **why hybrid sucks**.\\n\\n## Remote work\\n\\nFirst of all, let\u2019s be pragmatic \u2014 remote works. (Before people comment, of course if you\u2019re a factory worker or similar, this doesn\u2019t apply).\\n\\n### Advantages\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Increased employee retention and satisfaction:</strong> Remote work is seen as a desirable perk, improving job satisfaction and retention rates. You can check OpenBB team engagement <a href=\\"https://openbb.co/company/open/team\\">here</a>.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Expanded talent pool:</strong> It allows hiring from a global talent pool, resulting in a more diverse and skilled workforce, particularly in open source, where contributors come from all over the world.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Increased flexibility:</strong> Remote work offers employees more control over their schedules, leading to better work-life balance.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Improved productivity:</strong> There are fewer distractions and interruptions, which leads to increased productivity.</li>\\n    <li><strong>No commuting:</strong> Remote work eliminates the need to travel to the office, saving time, money, and energy.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Cost savings:</strong> It reduces expenses for both employees and employers, such as commuting and office-related costs.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n### Disadvantages\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Limited face-to-face interaction:</strong> Remote work reduces in-person collaboration and social connections among colleagues.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Communication challenges:</strong> Reliance on digital tools may lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations. There may also be technical issues or connectivity problems.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Blurred work-life boundaries:</strong> Clear separation between work and personal life becomes challenging.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Potential distractions:</strong> Remote work environments expose individuals to various distractions.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Challenges with collaboration:</strong> Coordinating tasks and scheduling can be more difficult remotely.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Reduced visibility and career advancement opportunities:</strong> Remote workers may have limited visibility and access to career growth.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nRemote works. It\u2019s not for everyone, but it works. It works particularly well when the company culture is built around it. For it to work exceptionally well, it boils down to two main arguments:\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>A strong leadership is necessary to keep the team aligned, motivated, and to create the company\u2019s culture</strong>. This helps mainly with the limited face-to-face interaction, challenges with collaboration, and reduced visibility and career advancement opportunities.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Do not track team members based on time but assess work based on output. Use meritocracy to reward the best team members and let go of low performers early</strong>. Remote work is not for everyone, and for those who cannot produce output/value to the company while working remotely, it means they weren\u2019t a good hire in the first place. In my personal opinion, the disadvantages of potential distractions and blurred work-life boundaries come down to the employee and their relationship with remote work, instead of the company.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nSometimes someone may not be producing as much value as expected, for one reason or another. _When you are working remotely, you accept that you will add value to the company, and time is no longer a measure. Thus, the emphasis on output/value becomes much stronger._\\n\\n## Office Work\\n\\nOffice also works.\\n\\n### Advantages\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Enhanced company culture:</strong> Offices contribute to a shared sense of identity and mission.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Face-to-face collaboration:</strong> It allows for immediate interaction, fostering effective teamwork and problem-solving.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Social interaction:</strong> Offices provide opportunities for building relationships with coworkers, enhancing camaraderie.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Clear work-life boundaries:</strong> Physical office spaces establish separation between work and personal life.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Mentorship and learning:</strong> In-person environments facilitate mentorship and hands-on learning.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Improved supervision:</strong> Physical presence aids in monitoring performance and providing timely feedback.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n### Disadvantages\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Commuting and transportation issues:</strong> Office work often involves commuting, which can lead to time-consuming and stressful travel, traffic congestion, and transportation expenses.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Lack of flexibility:</strong> Office work typically follows a fixed schedule, leaving less room for personal flexibility or adjustments to achieve work-life balance.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Office politics:</strong> Office environments can sometimes involve office politics, conflicts, or gossip that can affect productivity and job satisfaction.</li>\\n    <li><strong>High overhead costs:</strong> Maintaining physical office spaces can be costly for organizations, including expenses related to rent, utilities, and office supplies.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Limited geographic talent pool:</strong> Offices are often location-dependent, which may restrict access to a diverse and global talent pool, potentially limiting the variety of skills and perspectives within a workforce.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Distractions and interruptions:</strong> Open office layouts or noisy work environments can lead to frequent interruptions, reducing focus and productivity.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nOffice works. Most workers are used to office work, and there\u2019s a reason why it works so well, because it is easy for both the employee and the employer.\\n\\n**From the employee standpoint:** The routine of waking up, commuting, working for eight hours, commuting back, and then enjoying the evening is straightforward and requires minimal scheduling or organization. The job begins when the employee arrives at the office and ends when they leave. However, it\u2019s important to note that this fixed schedule does not necessarily guarantee peak performance throughout the entire workday.\\n\\nFor senior engineers, mentorship and learning opportunities may lead to context switching, disrupting deep focused work. What some refer to social interaction, can be perceived as wasting company resources. While supervision can raise the bar for average workers, top performers do not require constant supervision to excel. So if you\u2019re aiming for top performers, perhaps supervision isn\u2019t really necessary at all?\\n\\n**From the employer standpoint:** Leaders and managers may find it easier to have everyone in the office for quick communication and check-ins. However, relying on in-person communication may result in less documentation, which can be challenging for new joiners. Supervision becomes simpler as managers can track attendance and check on employees throughout the day, but this can also lead to time wasted for both the manager and the person being supervised. (Plus even that supervision allowed \u201cA day in a life of\u201d viral TikToks to highlighted inefficiencies).\\n\\n**In conclusion, I\u2019d say that your average worker will be better in the office, while your top performers will excel further in a remote environment.**\\n\\n> _The question is whether you prefer your top engineers to become 10x more productive working remotely or prefer your average engineers to improve performance by 2x. Personally, I prefer to aim for 10x productivity with top engineers and let go of average ones._\\n\\n## Hybrid Work\\n\\nOk, now that we\u2019ve discussed remote and office work, let\u2019s go over why hybrid work sucks.\\n\\nPeople in general tend to associate hybrid work with the best of remote and the best of office, but I think that the worst of remote and office have more emphasis. Let\u2019s go over the biggest pain points:\\n\\n<ol>\\n    <li><strong>Decreased productivity:</strong> When compared with remote or office, hybrid has lower productivity. This is due to the context switching associated with changing working environments. Personally, I have experienced this and found it frustrating to work until late at night, packing up and thinking about what I needed to carry for the next day, plus commuting. The next day, it took me much longer to get back into the flow of work compared to waking up and immediately continuing with the problem at hand.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Decreased flexibility:</strong> Hybrid work offers less flexibility than remote work but somewhat more than office work. However, this flexibility is often constrained by company policies, such as designated office and remote days or specific rules regarding remote work. When the company dictates the days employees can work remotely, the flexibility becomes somewhat artificial.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Communication challenges:</strong> As mentioned earlier, one of the reasons that office communication is a sword of 2 edges is because while in-person communication can be effective and fast, it often results in less documentation, which can impact new joiners. In a hybrid culture, this issue is so much worse, because it\u2019s hard to get the company aligned into the amount of level of documentation necessary. Plus, when WFH days rotate across divisions and teams, individuals working remotely may suffer from a lack of context that is shared among the team in the office, leading to silos and communication gaps.In addition to that in remote work employees can and expect to have to accommodate for different time zones but when you move people to hybrid the ones that need to go to the office will no longer adjust their times to match the ones WFH based on needs.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Blurred work-life boundaries:</strong> Hybrid work blurs the line between work and personal life. It no longer solely involves working from home and spending time with family but also includes being at work, interacting with co-workers, and commuting. This blurring can make it difficult to establish clear boundaries.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Limited geographic talent pool:</strong> Since you want employees to commute to the office a certain number of times per week or month, you can\u2019t hire them from anywhere. The geographic scope of talent acquisition becomes restricted, potentially limiting access to diverse skills and perspectives.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Many more distractions:</strong> Individuals face distractions both at home when working remotely and in the office from co-workers. PLUS, you get the distractions that come from your co-workers bringing you up to speed if something happened when you weren\u2019t in the office the day before (similar to the additional amount of chit chat that happens on Mondays due to weekend).</li>\\n    <li><strong>Costs and commuting:</strong> You may save some money with some WFH, but often the WFH days don\u2019t even justify going into a lower tier than a monthly subscription to public transports. So you end up spending the same, even if you travel less. This argument is less valid here in the Bay area where most people drive. Plus commuting those 3/4 days a week, is still a pain.When we talk about the employer costs then it\u2019s impossible to get it right. On the one hand you have too few people in the office which means you are overpaying for office space, on the other hand you cannot get everyone in. And this will always be impossible with a growing team + managing the WFH days of each team and division.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Decreased employee retention and satisfaction:</strong> In general, people tend to lean towards either remote work or office work. With hybrid work, those who prefer the office environment may work in the office most days, using WFH as an opportunity for personal tasks and potentially being less productive. On the other hand, those who prefer remote work will aim to WFH as much as possible and may feel dissatisfied with having to go to the office for the remaining days This can create a divide and decrease overall employee satisfaction. Additionally, this is even more pronounced when everyone in the leadership works in the office, since the company tends to follow culture from leaders and will have less incentives to accommodate team members that are not in the office.</li>\\n    <li><strong>Challenges with supervision:</strong> Physical presence in the office often aids in monitoring performance, but it becomes challenging to fairly evaluate the performance of team members in the office versus those working remotely in a hybrid setup. What is the basis that you use to evaluate them? Based on what you see when they are in the office? Do you still create ways to evaluate their output when WFH? Do you still check on them as often when the rest of your team is with you in the office? What about when you are WFH and have half of the team in the office and the other WFH? The amount of complexity that comes from managing this by itself, almost makes hybrid the worst choice.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI\u2019m not saying that hybrid work can\u2019t work, but my point is that people tend to use hybrid as the perfect solution between office and remote, and I don\u2019t think it is. In fact, I think for most companies, this is a way to sweep a problem under the rug with a half-baked solution.\\n\\nAs an engineer, I wouldn\u2019t be happy working in an office because I know I could contribute much more to the company by working from home. I\u2019d be \u201cokay\u201d with doing hybrid work in order to continue working for the company, but I would probably start looking elsewhere due to all the aforementioned issues.\\n\\nAs a leader, OpenBB has started as a remote company, and as a result, we have become highly efficient at working remotely, even when dealing with a 9-hour time difference. All team members understand that they need to make compromises with their working hours to accommodate the company\u2019s needs. _So, it ultimately comes down to the type of team you are building and how committed they are to the mission, as well as how you can cultivate such a culture internally._\\n\\nIf your team grew accustomed to working in an office and had to switch to remote due to COVID, and you are noticing a decrease in performance, it may be that your team was not prepared to work remotely. In that case, it makes sense to go back to the office. However, if your team grew while working remotely, and you are not satisfied with their performance, let me tell you that bringing the team back to the office is a half-baked solution. Instead, it would be better to investigate the issue and implement better processes or address underperforming individuals."},{"id":"become-an-openbb-champion","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/become-an-openbb-champion","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-06-10-become-an-openbb-champion.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-10-become-an-openbb-champion.md","title":"Become an OpenBB Champion","description":"Become an OpenBB Champion and join our passionate community.

In this blog post, we\u2019ll explore the significance of OpenBB Hub and why it truly matters for OpenBB users.\\n\\nBy delving into its key features, we\u2019ll uncover how OpenBB Hub elevates your experience with the OpenBB Terminal, providing you with enhanced capabilities and customization options. Let\u2019s dive in!\\n\\n## Login\\n\\nAs highlighted in our previous blog post [Introducing the OpenBB Hub](https://openbb.co/blog/introducing-the-openbb-hub), the OpenBB Hub is more than just a platform to access the OpenBB product ecosystem; it adds value to each individual product. Specifically, when it comes to the OpenBB Terminal, having an OpenBB Hub account offers tremendous advantages.\\n\\nNotably, the settings and features you configure within the hub persist across terminal updates and even when you log in from a new machine, allowing for a seamless and personalized experience.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNEZ6h2K9C4?si=qD9OmbHo9SGEkUM5\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\n## Streamlining API key management\\n\\nA common question we receive is about the source of our data. OpenBB doesn\u2019t own any data; instead, we enable users to access data from various vendors by signing up for plans on their respective websites. This approach allows us to focus on platform development and data standardization while giving users the freedom to pay for the high-quality datasets they desire.\\n\\nPreviously, managing API keys was only accessible through the terminal CLI, which could be suboptimal. To alleviate this, we introduced the capability to manage API keys directly from a web page, reducing friction and putting the focus back on what matters most: access to data.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IrHMEuWQiiQ?si=usaVWmOOWRPqEakq\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\n## Enhanced data customization\\n\\nWith OpenBB Hub, you have the power to set default data sources, enabling you to choose the data vendor that aligns best with your needs for each command within the terminal. This flexibility empowers you to curate your preferred data sources, providing a tailored experience that optimizes your decision-making process.\\n\\n## Infuse personal style into your terminal\\n\\nOpenBB Hub lets you personalize your terminal by customizing its colors to your liking. From the command line interface menu to interactive tables and even charting colors, you have the freedom to create your own custom color scheme. Whether you prefer soothing pastel shades or bold neon colors, the choice is yours.\\n\\nThis feature not only adds a touch of personalization but also ensures a comfortable and visually pleasing experience, reducing eye strain during extended usage. Say goodbye to the standard white background and say hello to a terminal that reflects your unique style.\\n\\n## Effortless routine scripts management\\n\\nWe\u2019ve noticed a growing trend among our users: the development and adoption of routine scripts.

After spending most of my teenage years in Portugal, I left sunny Lisbon \u2600\ufe0f to pursue a MSc. degree at Imperial College London \ud83d\udcbb. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve been living and working up until now. The main reasons behind my desire to move to San Francisco \u2600\ufe0f \ud83d\udcbb are the weather and the thriving tech ecosystem that surrounds it.\\n\\nDuring the Covid pandemic while in London, I took the opportunity to build my own [personal open source investment research platform](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal). This project allowed me to secure VC funding and establish a company called [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/). As the CEO of this company, I feel privileged to have the chance to make a lasting impact on the financial industry. Embracing this adventure and collaborating with individuals who are much smarter than I am is the least I can do for our team and for OpenBB.\\n\\nAs a first-time founder, I often find myself feeling slightly behind, which is why I\u2019m eager to absorb as much experience and knowledge as possible from other successful entrepreneurs. This is also why I managed to convince my wife and our dogs to join me in packing our bags and embarking on this journey into the unknown, much like my Portuguese ancestors did centuries ago \ud83d\udea2.\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s dive into what truly matters. This will be a lengthy ride, so make sure you\u2019re prepared for the journey ahead.\\n\\n## VISA\\n\\nFirst of all, you need to determine which visa you are eligible for in order to live and work in the US. You can find more information on this topic [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html).\\n\\nIn my case, I decided to apply for an \u201cO-1 Visa: Individuals with Extraordinary Ability or Achievement\u201d and specifically highlighted my extraordinary ability in the field of Computer Science, specifically within the subfield of Automated Systems. It is crucial to specify a particular field to make the defense process smoother.\\n\\nI had the privilege of working with an exceptional immigration lawyer who assisted me in crafting my case, significantly increasing my chances of a successful approval. Here is a portion of the O-1 Petition that was submitted:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-13-leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco_1.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, there is quite a bit of paperwork required to support your case. In my situation, I needed the following documents: Curriculum Vitae, university grades, transcripts and diplomas, LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, posts that gained viral attention on platforms like Reddit and HackerNews, podcasts and conferences where I had spoken, projects that received online praise, any media coverage I had received, scholarly scientific publications, expert opinion letters, and even emails or direct messages from venture capitalists or professionals in the industry.\\n\\nEssentially, any relevant evidence is used to strengthen your case. For me, the most crucial elements were the expert opinion letters provided by our lead investor, former colleagues, or respected individuals in the field who were familiar with my work, as well as the research papers I had published and the media coverage I had received.\\n\\nOnce my O-1 visa was approved, I simply needed to take my passport to the US embassy in London to obtain the visa stamp. It\u2019s worth noting that if the wait time at the US embassy is lengthy, you have the option to visit another US embassy in another country where the process may be faster.\\n\\n## Arriving to the country\\n\\nI arrived in California on my own initially, with the plan for my wife and dogs to join me later. Thankfully, I had some contacts in California who provided me with their phone number and house address, which was helpful for getting settled. Since I didn\u2019t have a phone before finding an apartment, I had to rely on roaming data using my plan from the UK, which resulted in additional expenses.\\n\\nI would suggest either having a good deal for data roaming and international calls outside your country or obtaining a prepaid US phone. The latter is especially important if you\u2019re traveling alone because I often encountered registration forms that didn\u2019t accept foreign phone numbers.\\n\\nRegarding payments, I used my Revolut VISA card, which offers excellent foreign exchange rates for converting pounds to dollars. It\u2019s worth noting that I couldn\u2019t open a US bank account without a Social Security Number (SSN).\\n\\n### Social Security Number (SSN)\\n\\nIf you know someone in the US, it is advisable to apply for a Social Security Number (SSN) as soon as possible and provide their address and contact information if you don\u2019t have a US address of your own. An SSN is necessary for various purposes, and it may take up to two weeks for the card to arrive. When going to you nearest Social Security Administration (SSA) office, I would suggest arriving 30 minutes before opening hours to avoid long queues.\\n\\nTo apply for an SSN, you will need to bring the following documents to the SSA office: your passport, the I-797 form (O-1 visa approval notice), and the I-94 form (arrival record in the US).\\n\\n### Transportation\\n\\nI had the fortunate opportunity of having a friend lend me a car as soon as I arrived in California, and it made my life ten times easier. I highly recommend having something lined up in terms of transportation, as having a car enables you to get anywhere you need to go much more efficiently. To ensure I was covered, I simply needed to arrange car insurance. I opted for [Progressive](https://www.progressive.com/), and the process was quick and straightforward.\\n\\nWhile settling in, I occasionally relied on public transportation instead of driving, especially when traveling to the center of San Francisco. It took me some time to adjust to driving in the US, so public transport was a convenient alternative. If you plan on using public transportation services like BART or Caltrain, I suggest visiting [this website](https://www.iliveinthebayarea.com/knowledge-center/transit/) that provides information on available transportation options. It\u2019s also a good idea to purchase a [Clipper card](https://www.clippercard.com/), which allows you to load funds and easily tap it when boarding.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you anticipate passing through tolls, bridges, or utilizing the fast lane on the freeway, I recommend looking into acquiring a [Fastrack transponder](https://www.thetollroads.com/accounts/fastrak/transponder/) for a more seamless experience.\\n\\n## Finding an apartment\\n\\nApartment hunting proved to be quite stressful, considering that every day spent searching meant unnecessary expenses piling up while I still had my company to manage.\\n\\nUsing Uber for transportation was convenient and efficient, but the costs could add up quickly with multiple trips. To save money, I recommend scheduling house viewings on the same day in specific areas of interest and simply walking from one location to another.\\n\\nWhile dealing with lease agents, I encountered a mix of competence levels. Some were highly efficient, while others were less so. If you\u2019re genuinely interested in a particular apartment, it\u2019s important to exert some pressure to keep the process moving forward. Don\u2019t hesitate to call and inquire about updates.\\n\\nI was fond of the first house we saw, so I promptly paid $300, which covered certain fees. These fees were refundable if we decided not to proceed, but more importantly, they ensured that the house would be taken off the market. At this stage, both the agents and I wanted the process to move as quickly as possible. In our case, the target timeframe was three business days; if the process exceeded that, the house would be made available again.\\n\\nEven if you believe you\u2019ve found the perfect apartment, I still recommend continuing your search until the lease contract is signed. It\u2019s crucial to secure the apartment before assuming it\u2019s yours.\\n\\nBefore obtaining the keys, we had several tasks to complete: making the first payment, setting up utilities ([PG&E](https://www.pge.com/) for Gas and Electricity, and [Conservice](https://utilitiesinfo.conservice.com/) for water), providing proof of renter\u2019s liability insurance (I used [Assurant](https://assurantrenters.com/)\u2019s as it was conveniently associated with the community), and undergoing a pet screening (note that certain dog breeds are considered more dangerous and may not be accepted).\\n\\nMost importantly, my salary alone wasn\u2019t sufficient to guarantee that we could afford the rent. I needed a guarantor to vouch for me, as Europe does not have the concept of credit ratings.\\n\\nFortunately, our lead investor graciously agreed to be our guarantor when I asked him. Without someone fulfilling this role, I would have had to rely on a third-party service and pay several thousands of dollars, which would have been non-refundable and solely for the right to lease the house. This arrangement seemed rather illogical.\\n\\n## After the apartment\\n\\nI needed to notify [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/) of my new address since the last one on file was associated with the hotel where I was staying. I informed them that my new residence would be the updated address.\\n\\nFollowing that, my dogs flew from the UK using [Pets abroad UK](https://www.petsabroaduk.co.uk/). To save money, my wife didn\u2019t accompany them on the flight; instead, she arranged for them to be transported in the cargo hold of the airplane while I waited at the destination.\\n\\nHowever, I must admit that I didn\u2019t enjoy the experience, and in hindsight, I would have been willing to pay more for my dogs to have a better and safer flight. Although flying them from London, meant that unfortunately cargo was the option due to UK requirements. When I picked them up, they were visibly scared, and both my wife and I held our breath with worry throughout their entire journey. Our dogs\u2019 well-being was of utmost importance to us.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-13-leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco_2.png)\\n\\nThe house was mostly empty, so to save money, we acquired a lot of second-hand items for free. It was beneficial to know people in the area who were aware of others with unused items stored in their garages, which we were able to take. To retrieve this furniture and other objects, we either needed to rent a U-Haul (which wasn\u2019t possible without a California driver\u2019s license) or hire a moving company.\\n\\nOur next task was to search for second-hand items at significant discounts on websites such as [Craigslist](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/), [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/) and [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace). However, we had to be cautious of scammers and remember that if a deal seemed too good to be true, it probably was.\\n\\nOnce we had gathered most of the second-hand items, we visited [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/) to paint and improve the newly acquired furniture. For the items we couldn\u2019t find second-hand, we made purchases at [Costco](https://www.costco.com/).\\n\\nWe highly recommend getting an executive membership at Costco as it provides great value for money. Additionally, the gas prices at Costco are significantly cheaper compared to other places we\u2019ve seen.\\n\\n### Wi-Fi + Mobile plan\\n\\nAfter securing an apartment, I used my passport to visit an [AT&T](https://www.att.com/) store. Since I didn\u2019t have my SSN yet, they were accommodating and allowed me to use my passport for identification. However, if you choose a different service provider like Xfinity, you will need your SSN. Before selecting a plan, it\u2019s important to check the coverage in your area to ensure that 4G/5G works well.\\n\\nInitially, I set up Wi-Fi through Xfinity, but then I used that as leverage to negotiate a discount with AT&T. This worked because I was interested in a double play package, which included two phone plans and Wi-Fi. As a result, I obtained an e-sim with unlimited 5G data for both myself and my wife, along with Wi-Fi for our home, at a cost of approximately $150 per month.\\n\\n### Shopping\\n\\nThere\u2019s going to be a big shock in terms of prices; at least, we experienced one. Life in the Bay Area is over 2x more expensive than London.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-13-leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco_3.png)\\n\\nSo, we started learning how to buy things at a lower cost. Whole Foods is not a viable option as it\u2019s one of the most expensive stores. The 10 items above cost $69.34 on Whole Foods.\\n\\nInstead, we now tend to shop at Safeway and always try to time our visits to take advantage of discounts. Many shopping places offer coupons that can help you save a lot of money. Additionally, when you come across products on sale, it\u2019s better to buy them in larger quantities as it\u2019s usually worth it.\\n\\nMy wife is also a big fan of Trader Joe\u2019s with the prices there being quite reasonable too. They also have a great selection of cheeses which is a must being from Europe.\\n\\n## After obtaining an SSN\\n\\nAfter you obtain your SSN, there are a lot of new things that you are able to do since you are recognized as a \u201cperson.\u201d\\n\\n### Bank account\\n\\nCredit cards are recommended over debit cards, not just because of the security benefits, but also because of the credit rating associated with them. This is a concept that doesn\u2019t really exist in Europe but is significant in the US. Your credit score will determine whether you are approved for a loan and what interest rate you will be charged.\\n\\nThe agencies that handle your credit score are [Equifax.com](http://equifax.com/), [TransUnion.com](http://transunion.com/) and [Experian.com](http://experian.com/). It\u2019s free to register, and you should keep an eye on your credit files to ensure that your credit score doesn\u2019t decrease for any reason.\\n\\nWe ended up opening an account with [Bank of America](https://www.bankofamerica.com/). However, since we didn\u2019t have a credit score yet, we couldn\u2019t get a regular credit card. Instead, we had to apply for a secured credit card, where the maximum spending limit is determined by the amount of cash we use to back the credit card.\\n\\nWe also applied for an [AMEX card](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-everyday/?eep=26129&irgwc=1&veid=39E0XuRS3xyNT4BTy33WSUXYUkAwp0Tx32Qt0c0&affid=1193684&pid=IR&affname=NerdWallet%2C+Inc.&sid=14011830016&pmc=795&BUID=CCG&CRTV=controlaffcps&MPR=03) because [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/) has a partnership with the international credit-reporting startup Nova Credit. This allows immigrants to instantly translate credit reports from the UK to U.S.-equivalent credit reports when applying for AmEx consumer cards. However, it\u2019s important to note that AMEX cards are less widely accepted compared to VISA and MasterCard, so we were aware that they would only work in certain establishments.\\n\\nFor more information, these video were extremely helpful:\\n\\n- [Building credit and keeping yours healthy](https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/credit/building-credit)\\n- [How to build credit from scratch](https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/credit/start-building-credit)\\n- [Top 3 credit questions](https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/credit/top-credit-questions)\\n\\n### Car\\n\\nIt was now time for us to buy a car. We searched online for a few options. There are two things worth considering when buying a used car, as we did:\\n\\n- Firstly, you can use [https://www.kbb.com/car-values/](https://www.kbb.com/car-values/) to research the value of the car. This ensures that you don\u2019t get ripped off and provides an estimate of how much the car is worth based on the details you provide.\\n- Secondly, you can use [https://www.carfax.com/](https://www.carfax.com/) to research a car and its license plate. This helps you understand its accident history and any repairs it has undergone. It provides information about whether there have been major accidents in the car\u2019s history, frequent visits to the mechanic, and whether the repairs were done by authorized mechanics (e.g., BMW) or not.\\n\\nIf you prefer to play it safe, you can even bring a mechanic with you to the dealership to assess the car\u2019s condition.\\n\\nWe spoke with individuals, but ultimately decided to buy a car from a dealership because it offered fewer risks compared to buying from individuals. Moreover, the dealership took care of updating the vehicle records, ensuring that the vehicle would be registered under our name. This allowed us to update our car insurance with the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of the new vehicle.\\n\\nAfter a few months, we received the California Certificate of Title, which confirmed that I was the legal owner of the vehicle and included important vehicle identification information. Since this was my first car, I had to add an OpenBB reference to the front plate :)\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-13-leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco_4.png)\\n\\nShoutouts to:\\n\\n- [Jiffy Lube](https://www.jiffylube.com/) for their car inspection services, tire inflation, oil changes, and more. They don\u2019t charge for the inspection and only charge for the services performed on the car. We had a great experience with them.\\n- [Costco gas station](https://www.costco.com/gasoline.html) for the cheapest gas we\u2019ve found so far.\\n\\n### Health Insurance\\n\\nCalifornia offers a portal called [Covered California](https://www.coveredca.com/), which provides state-approved health plans from various insurance companies. If your income is low, the state can subsidize your monthly premium. These plans fall into three categories, each with differences in costs and provider networks:\\n\\n<ol>\\n  <li>HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations): Typically cheaper than PPOs, HMOs have smaller networks. You need to see your primary care physician before getting a referral to a specialist.</li>\\n  <li>PPOs (Preferred Provider Organizations): Usually more expensive, PPOs offer a larger network and the ability to see providers outside of the network. You can also see specialists without a referral.</li>\\n  <li>EPOS (Exclusive Provider Organizations): EPOS plans combine features of HMOs and PPOs. They have exclusive networks like HMOs, making them generally less expensive. However, you can make your own appointments with specialists, similar to PPOs.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\nIn our case, we chose an HMO called Kaiser. [Kaiser](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/northern-california/front-door) is a not-for-profit, all-inclusive healthcare company with its own doctors and hospitals. When selecting the plan within Kaiser, we had to choose between Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers. These tiers are influenced by three main factors:\\n\\n<ol>\\n  <li><strong>Monthly premium:</strong> The amount you pay each month for health plan coverage. It may be subsidized based on your income and household size.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Annual deductible:</strong> The amount you must pay before your plan starts covering services.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Annual maximum out-of-pocket:</strong> The total amount you pay in a calendar year (in addition to monthly premiums) for most services covered by your health care plan.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n### California Driving License\\n\\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is responsible for vehicle registrations and driving licenses in California. When you arrive in California, you can use a foreign driving license for only 10 days, after which you must obtain a California Driving License (CDL).\\n\\nTo apply for the CDL, you can start the process online by completing the driver\u2019s license application on the [DMV website](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/). This online application saves time by allowing you to fill it out before visiting a DMV field office.\\n\\nWhen you visit the DMV, the employees will review your completed application and request certain documents, including:\\n\\n- Social Security Number (SSN)\\n- Unexpired foreign passport with a valid U.S. visa\\n- Approved I-94 form\\n- Bank and financial institution records\\n- Insurance documents\\n\\nAfter submitting the required documents, you will have your picture taken and then proceed to take the written driving test. It\u2019s advisable to practice for the test in advance. As I have many years of driving experience, I personally used practice tests available at [https://www.dmv-written-test.com/california/practice-test-1.html](https://www.dmv-written-test.com/california/practice-test-1.html).\\n\\nA few days later, I returned to the DMV to take the written test. The test consists of 36 multiple-choice questions, and you are allowed to fail up to 6 questions. You will immediately know whether you passed or not.\\n\\nUpon passing the written test, you will receive a document that allows you to schedule your driving exam. It is recommended to book the exam as soon as possible, as available slots may be several weeks away due to high demand.\\n\\nOn the day of the driving exam, you will need to bring someone who holds a CDL, the document provided after passing the written exam, and your passport.\\n\\nThe driving exam evaluates your performance, and you will receive a score sheet outlining the criteria and aspects that will be assessed during the exam. This will give you an idea of what to expect and what the examiners will be evaluating.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-13-leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco_5.png)\\n\\nAfter successfully passing the driving exam, the DMV will issue you a temporary document that serves as your California Driving License (CDL). This temporary document will allow you to legally drive while you wait for your physical CDL to be sent to you by mail.\\n\\nIt typically takes a few months for the physical CDL to be processed and mailed to your designated address. During this time, you can use the temporary document as proof of your driving privileges in California. Once you receive the physical CDL, you should carry it with you whenever you are driving.\\n\\nIt\u2019s important to note that the temporary document and the physical CDL have the same validity and serve as official proof of your driver\u2019s license status.\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nI\u2019ve moved countries a few times within Europe, and those moves were much easier than moving to the USA.\\n\\nNonetheless, I think you can get settled within 3 months of moving to the country. So far, we are really enjoying our experience and can\u2019t wait to explore more of the area.\\n\\nIf you are looking to do the same and want some feedback, feel free to reach out. It helped us a lot to have people who could help us with the move, so I\u2019d love to be able to do the same for others."},{"id":"fully-free-financial-chatbot","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/fully-free-financial-chatbot","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-05-09-fully-free-financial-chatbot.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-09-fully-free-financial-chatbot.md","title":"Fully free financial chatbot","description":"The OpenBB Bot is a financial chatbot that allows you to access financial data from Discord or Telegram along with other users.

Instead of adding the chat functionality to OpenBB Terminal, we brought investment research data where these communities were already having fruitful discussions (Discord and Telegram). This makes much more sense from a user-convenience standpoint, and that\u2019s how the OpenBB Bot was born. More information [here](https://my.openbb.co/app/bot).\\n\\nAs much customization as the OpenBB Terminal allowed, we didn\u2019t give creators as much freedom as we could have since they would need to download the source code of the terminal in order to leverage our core.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-05-free-investment-research-ecosystem-to-consistently-beat-the-market_1.png)\\n\\nBut we we wanted to make this experience as seamless as possible so users could build on top of our foundation. Thus, we repurposed the core of the OpenBB Terminal into an OpenBB SDK that is \u201c_pip installable_\u201d from everywhere \u2014 [OpenBB](https://pypi.org/project/openbb/) . This means that all you need to have access to a universe of investment research data programmatically is python and running pip install openbb within a notebook.\\n\\nThis was a big win since the community reaction was very positive and we are now seeing it adopted by investors, educational courses, and even content creators. So much that we even created a tab to keep track of these on our [/open page](https://openbb.co/open).\\n\\nHowever, we focused too much on the products and didn\u2019t slow down to think about the user experience utilizing multiple OpenBB products. This is where OpenBB Hub comes into play. [OpenBB Hub](https://my.openbb.co/) is the platform we use to interact with our community, push OpenBB content, allow product management, and much more.\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\n- Allows to manage your OpenBB Terminal API keys, feature flags and settings. In addition, we allow users to save & share their openbb script routines\\n- Allows access to the OpenBB Terminal installer new versions\\n- Allows access to the OpenBB Bot dashboard \u2014 which allows fully customization from a user perspective. This improves your experience by 10x when using OpenBB Bot on Telegram or Discord.\\n- Allows to sign-up for early waitlist of OpenBB Terminal Pro\\n\\n## OpenBB Hub - OpenBB Terminal\\n\\nSince the beginning users have installed the OpenBB Terminal in multiple desktops due to its free nature. The issue? The API key management was a pain since there was not a way to sync these across different machines. Until now.\\n\\nWith [OpenBB Hub](https://my.openbb.co/) and using that account detail to log in the terminal, this problem gets fixed. Not only that, but users will benefit from default data sources, terminal color schema customization and even .openbb routines being manageable from Hub and more importantly accessible on a terminal instance as long as they login with their user details.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-05-free-investment-research-ecosystem-to-consistently-beat-the-market_2.png)\\n\\n## OpenBB Hub - OpenBB Bot\\n\\nToday we are also announcing the OpenBB Bot will be fully free for individuals. All you have to do is to register for the [OpenBB Hub](https://my.openbb.co/).\\n\\nFor users that were already users of our OpenBB Bot, the only change on the platform is pricing and an increase push towards better documentation and more tutorials. This is an initiative that we are taking company-wide to focus on better documentation and more content to fully leverage our suite of products.\\n\\nOpenBB bot is critical to us as we work hard towards making a full ecosystem for investment research. And now you can access this experience for free, and share investment research data with your friends / colleagues.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-05-free-investment-research-ecosystem-to-consistently-beat-the-market_3.png)\\n\\n## OpenBB Hub - OpenBB SDK\\n\\nAs the OpenBB SDK is in its core a pip installable package with its [own page on PiPy](https://pypi.org/project/openbb/) there aren\u2019t a lot of functionalities that we can make available in this page. We allow the user to set their API keys similarly to what we do in the Terminal, to improve UX when utilizing the SDK.\\n\\nIn addition, we are going to display open source projects built by the community that leverage our core so that they can serve as an inspiration to you. If you are working on something that uses OpenBB at its core, tag your GitHub repository with \u201copenbb\u201d and we\u2019ll add you to the list of projects that rely on our foundation.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-05-free-investment-research-ecosystem-to-consistently-beat-the-market_4.png)\\n\\n## OpenBB Hub - OpenBB Terminal Pro (waitlist)\\n\\nIf all these features weren\u2019t enough, we have decided to open the [OpenBB Terminal Pro WAITLIST](https://my.openbb.co/app/pro/early-access) for users who register on our OpenBB Hub.\\n\\nThe OpenBB Terminal Pro is something that has been months in the works and is yet our most exciting product to date. We have been holding back on it because we believe this will change the way investors think about investing. This time we worked with design partners and had dozens of user interviews from financial professionals to understand their pain points and what role we could fill. So even being able to start creating a waitlist around it is something that the team is very excited about.\\n\\nWe will gradually roll out the OpenBB Terminal Pro to a few users from the waitlist to get early feedback.\\n\\nIf you are one of these, I look forward to onboarding you personally \ud83e\udd1d\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-05-05-free-investment-research-ecosystem-to-consistently-beat-the-market_5.png)\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nAlthough OpenBB Hub is not a product per se, the amount of work that the team put together to make this happen is something nothing short of extraordinary. This was the first project where the entire team (~20 people from engineering, product, design and marketing) had to work together as whole.\\n\\nThe OpenBB Terminal dashboard is completely new, the concept of login had to be invented and needed to function perfectly with the Hub. The SDK page is also new. The OpenBB Bot dashboard already existed, but we made the tier for individuals completely free, so we had to update it to reflect that big pricing change. And finally, we open the OpenBB Terminal Pro waitlist.\\n\\nThe [OpenBB Hub](https://my.openbb.co/) is completely free.\\n\\nAll you have to do is to register so we can know more information about yourself regarding your primary usage for our products (professional, academic, personal) \u2014 this allows us to understand what features to prioritize in the future and improve the quality of our products.\\n\\nIn case you missed the webinar, you can view it below so that you are up-to-date with all the exciting new features that the team has released.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4dQs_q_Jtk?si=76h-YFtiqkATHisF\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\n<br />"},{"id":"the-role-of-ai-and-openbb-in-the-future-of-investment-research","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-role-of-ai-and-openbb-in-the-future-of-investment-research","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-04-03-the-role-of-ai-and-openbb-in-the-future-of-investment-research.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-03-the-role-of-ai-and-openbb-in-the-future-of-investment-research.md","title":"The role of AI and OpenBB in the future of investment research","description":"How OpenBB can lead the future of finance using AI on top of an open source investment research platform.","date":"2023-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openai","permalink":"/blog/tags/openai"},{"inline":true,"label":"future","permalink":"/blog/tags/future"},{"inline":true,"label":"chatgpt","permalink":"/blog/tags/chatgpt"},{"inline":true,"label":"discord","permalink":"/blog/tags/discord"}],"readingTime":4.43,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-role-of-ai-and-openbb-in-the-future-of-investment-research","title":"The role of AI and OpenBB in the future of investment research","date":"2023-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2023-04-03-the-role-of-ai-and-openbb-in-the-future-of-investment-research.png","tags":["openai","future","chatgpt","discord"],"description":"How OpenBB can lead the future of finance using AI on top of an open source investment research platform."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Free investment research ecosystem to consistently beat the market","permalink":"/blog/free-investment-research-ecosystem-to-consistently-beat-the-market"},"nextItem":{"title":"How I Used OpenAI API to improve our product documentation","permalink":"/blog/how-i-used-openai-api-to-improve-our-product-documentation"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2023-04-03-the-role-of-ai-and-openbb-in-the-future-of-investment-research.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nHow OpenBB can lead the future of finance using AI on top of an open source investment research platform.\\n\\nThe open source code is available [here](https://github.com/openbb-finance/OpenBBTerminal).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThis blogpost won\'t speak about what the OpenBB Terminal can offer today. Instead, we are going to share where we think AI can play a role in the future of investment research, and how through an open source platform, we can lead that wave.\\n\\nA lot of this blog is based on the fact that the OpenBB Terminal is an open source investment research platform, and therefore it\'s very relevant to read [our blogpost about why we are open source](/blog/why-the-need-for-an-open-source-investment-research-platform).\\n\\nNote: This blogpost will share several proof-of-concepts that are still within R&D and are not yet ready for production. Also, this blogpost will assume that you are aware of LLMs such as ChatGPT and WhisperAI.\\n\\n## ChatGPT as the interface\\n\\nAn edge that incumbents have is the fact that they have been around for a very long time and spent a lot on educating users about their product. As a result, users are used to their platform. This makes it harder for users to switch to an unknown product, meaning they need to be 10x better than the competition for them to do so.\\n\\nHowever, what if there was no learning curve? What if you could use a product for the first time and know how to access all the information you wanted without spending any time reading the documentation? In essence, the educational incumbent advantage would become obsolete.\\n\\nWith the new LLM advancements, such as ChatGPT. We are not far from this reality. Below is a proof-of-concept of what this could look like:\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FeYgQxnF_VY?si=3ZuXnyrWdW4UkqQy\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\nPlus, if this is built on top of an open source project it means that the community can help in improving the model by providing more training data (e.g. provide a text as input and the corresponding command as output) or even confirm whether or not the chart that pops up was accurate.\\n\\nIn addition, along with data sources you can imagine that the community could start contributing with new languages for the GPT model. This makes using a new investment research platform easy, but more importantly makes retrieving information much faster and efficient.\\n\\nThe screenshot below shows that ChatGPT can accurately return the right OpenBB command when the user requests a certain type of data, as long as the model can be trained on our documentation:\\n\\n![image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*IWnSMNhHDyiulxri_hEB0g.png)\\n\\nEDIT: Bloomberg introduced [BloombergGPT](https://openai.com/research/whisper) last week, and the following screenshot is taken from their research paper which validates the argument above.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-04-03-the-role-of-ai-and-openbb-in-the-future-of-investment-research_1.png)\\n\\n## WhisperAI as the interface\\n\\nIf we go one step further, instead of relying on text as input, the platform could rely on voice. With models such as [WhisperAI](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance) we will be able to speak with the platform in order to retrieve financial data.\\n\\nBelow is a proof-of-concept showing how you can retrieve this data through voice.\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto\\">\\n    <iframe\\n        src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CHti3nmWGY?si=yLF5AFHe91JFVgaS\\"\\n        width=\\"800\\"\\n        height=\\"400\\"\\n    />\\n</div>\\n\\nOne of the advantages of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is the fact that it doesn\'t rely solely on english and therefore, it would welcome people from all over the world to interact with the platform.

But for new users, these 4 words may not mean much.\\n\\nFor context, this is the output that a user would get if running `/dp alldp` on our [Discord server](https://openbb.co/discord).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-04-01-how-i-used-openai-api-to-improve-our-product-documentation_2.png)\\n\\nSo I talked with someone in our team about improving the documentation. Not only for the new users that wanted to utilize our free product but also so that we could train our own LLM on this better dataset.\\n\\nOver the weekend I had the idea: What if I provided ChatGPT with the current description and an example of how to use the command and asked it to provide a more detailed description?\\n\\nSo the next step was to try whether ChatGPT would indeed improve the current documentation.\\n\\nAfter a bit of prompt tweaking, I got a much better description than the one we currently had. See below:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-04-01-how-i-used-openai-api-to-improve-our-product-documentation_3.png)\\n\\nThe next step was rather straightforward. I created a script that iterated [through all our OpenBB Bot Discord documentation](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) files and updated the old description with a more detailed one.\\n\\nThis is the template prompt that I used:\\n\\n> _Context: You are a developer writing a detailed documentation for a function that allows the user to retrieve desc utilizing the command example how would you explain what this command does in a single paragraph\u201d_\\n\\nWhere **desc** and **example** corresponds to the current description and example that each of our commands have, respectively.\\n\\nThe results can be seen below (done on [this PR](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/pull/4657)),\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-04-01-how-i-used-openai-api-to-improve-our-product-documentation_4.png)\\n\\nAs usual, I open source the script [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/improve-documentation-using-openai).\\n\\nThe funny thing is that I used an LLM output to improve our documentation.

Being good at interviews will no longer suffice to get a job in top tech company. Conventional CVs are too boring. Recruiters may like what they read, but this doesn\u2019t make them think any further about a person and think \u201cwow, we really need someone like them\u201d.\\n\\nUltimately, a CV cannot demonstrate creativity and in my opinion, to be a top engineer you need to be creative. Often there isn\u2019t an easy straightforward solution and being creative is what distinguishes top tier engineers from medium. I wrote a post about this [here](/blog/stop-doing-your-cv-in-word-or-latex).\\n\\nBelow I will let you know my views on what I would do to get a job at an exciting tech startup.\\n\\n## Work on open source projects\\n\\nOpen source is a great way to build your skills and get your name out there. It\u2019s also a great way to make connections with other developers, which can lead to referrals and job opportunities. If you want to show that you\u2019re a good engineer, open source is an excellent opportunity. This is because it allows you to demonstrate your problem-solving abilities, while also improving the codebase of a project that is potentially used by thousands of users \u2014 and because the project is open source, it never dies.\\n\\n**But which open source projects should you choose?**\\n\\nI\u2019d say that there are two routes that you can take here. You can select the project based on your **own use case** or you can **be strategic** about it.\\n\\n### Own use case\\n\\nDon\u2019t overthink it. The world of software is built on top of open source. If it weren\u2019t for open source, we would be living in the year 2000 or less. This means that your favorite apps are relying on open source projects, which you can be a part of!\\n\\nThis means that you can:\\n\\n- Contribute to an open source library that is used by a project that you like. E.g. someone from our team is a [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython) contributor.\\n- Contribute to a product that you use that is Open Source. The advantage here is that you are able to literally customize the product that you are using.\\n\\nWith Red Hat in the 90s this open source movement is starting to be a very hot topic. [Joseph Jacks](https://twitter.com/JosephJacks_) from OSS Capital is one of the best investors (if not the best) in this space. The chart below that he put together illustrates well the growth of open source (shared in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/JosephJacks_/status/1494840009882361859?s=20))\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-01-22-how-to-get-hired-by-an-exciting-tech-startup-in-2023_1.png)\\n\\n### Strategic\\n\\nIf you\u2019re reading this, there\u2019s a good chance that you want to make a positive impact on the future of technology. If so, it can be helpful to consider how your work will affect the lives of others. Take some time and think about what kind of role you would like to play in shaping those futures \u2014 are you someone who wants to improve people\u2019s physical well-being through health innovations? Or maybe achieve more efficient energy use through new technologies? This will help determine which companies or projects might be best suited for any given career path.\\n\\nOnce you figure out what motivates you, select an industry where you wish to find a job.\\n\\nThen there are multiple paths that you can take:\\n\\n- Look into the signals provided by top venture capital firms in that selected industry. I.e. see what open source companies are being backed in that space.\\n- Look into the developer engagement around the open source projects in that industry. You can not only use GitHub stars and forks, but you can use tools such as [https://analyzemyrepo.com](https://analyzemyrepo.com/analyze/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) or [https://ossinsight.io/](https://ossinsight.io/)\\n- Cold email VCs to ask them about which open source products they are excited about. I say VCs because often their job is to find these startups early, so usually they have more recent information. But talking with devs or listening to people that you respect in the industry is equally valid.\\n\\nNote: By being an early contributor of a promising open source startup, you can become a core maintainer of a project and even make it to the founding team. This is how I met James, OpenBB\u2019s co-founder. He was an active developer in my own open source project, and I invited him to be part of the main maintainers of the project. When we built a company, he became a founding member.\\n\\n## Develop your own open source project\\n\\nI strongly believe that being able to successfully build your own open source project is severely underrated. There are so many components that you need to get right from so many departments that it shows a lot about your strengths as an individual and a preview of the value you could add to the team.\\n\\nYou may think that the only thing that you are demonstrating is your ability to write high-quality code since it will be open to the public. Well that\u2019s wrong. Here is a non-exhaustive list of skills that you show off\\n\\n- Solution to a real-world problem\\n- Design around the product\\n- User experience\\n- How you prioritize task and how fast you can ship high-quality code\\n- Interaction with others\\n- Marketing\\n- Listening to feedback from users\\n\\nThis is what I did with OpenBB Terminal: [https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) and it has single handedly changed my life.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIf you\u2019re looking for a job in 2023, the best thing you can do is to contribute to/develop open source projects.\\n\\nYou should be aware that you can also add value to an open source project by reporting bugs. You can even do more than just report a bug, but suggest a solution or workaround for the problem \u2014 this shows that not only are you paying attention to what\u2019s going on around you, but also that you have some ideas about how things could be improved \u2014 a combination that any hiring manager would love!\\n\\nI hope you found this post insightful.\\n\\nAny feedback is welcome."},{"id":"financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why.md","title":"Financial chat bots are underrated, and here\u2019s why.","description":"In this blog post, we discuss the underrated potential of financial chat bots, our collaboration with OptionsFamBot, and why chat bots are becoming increasingly popular.","date":"2023-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"chatbots","permalink":"/blog/tags/chatbots"},{"inline":true,"label":"finance","permalink":"/blog/tags/finance"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"discord","permalink":"/blog/tags/discord"},{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"optionsfambot","permalink":"/blog/tags/optionsfambot"}],"readingTime":4.92,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why","title":"Financial chat bots are underrated, and here\u2019s why.","date":"2023-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why.png","tags":["chatbots","finance","ai","discord","openbb","optionsfambot"],"description":"In this blog post, we discuss the underrated potential of financial chat bots, our collaboration with OptionsFamBot, and why chat bots are becoming increasingly popular."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to get hired by an exciting tech startup in 2023","permalink":"/blog/how-to-get-hired-by-an-exciting-tech-startup-in-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Firing sucks.

This was a bot that had a reach of over 1 Million users on Discord.\\n\\nToday, [OpenBB Bot](https://openbb.co/products/bot) is one of our more powerful products and I still think a lot of people are sleeping on it.\\n\\n### What is a chatting bot platform?\\n\\nAccording to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat):\\n\\n> _\u201cA chatbot platform is a software service or tool that enables the creation, management, and deployment of chatbots. These platforms typically provide a variety of tools and features for building, testing, and deploying chatbots, as well as options for integrating chatbots with other systems or services. Some chatbot platforms are designed to support the development of chatbots for specific industries or use cases, such as customer service, e-commerce, or marketing. Others are more general purpose, and can be used to build chatbots for a wide range of applications.\u201d_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n### Why are chat bots not engaging?\\n\\nI believe that one of the reasons for this is because people usually associate chatbots with customer service or marketing. Not as a finalized product but as a feature.\\n\\nIf I ask ChatGPT about this, the main reasons are: Lack of personalized conversation, limited capabilities, poor design and high error rate.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_1.png)\\n\\nBut wait.. ChatGPT is **LITERALLY** a chat bot. Everything happens through a chat interface, which shows that you can build a successful product as a bot, as long as it adds enough value to the user.\\n\\nOne could argue that ChatGPT is not done in an established chatting platform, and that is **partially true**. The reason I say partially is because ChatGPT has an API, so developers can use it to develop their own chatting bots and deploy it in whatever chatting app they are interested in.\\n\\n## Examples of good chatting platforms\\n\\nI believe that Discord is in the forefront here due to: Free, easy to use, allows customizing servers with roles/channels/permissions, high-quality voice chat, strong communities.\\n\\nA testament to this is the fact that [midjourney](https://midjourney.com/) has built a successful chat bot that generates images from text prompts using AI, **SOLELY** relying on Discord. If you go into their website, the button \u201c**Join the Beta**\u201d takes you to their Discord server which has over **7 million users**!\\n\\nAs far as I know, this is the only example of a company that distributes their product solely through a chatting platform in a successful way.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_2.png)\\n\\n## Why are chat bots getting more popular?\\n\\nIn my opinion, there are a few factors why chat bots are becoming more popular:\\n\\n### Interactivity\\n\\nThe bots are becoming more interactive, almost working like an application within a chatting platform.\\n\\n![interactivity](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_3.png)\\n\\n### Speed\\n\\nThe speed of interaction is increasing over time, making the experience more seamless.\\n\\n![speed](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_4.png)\\n\\n### Customization\\n\\nThe level of customization allowed for these bots keeps on increasing.\\n\\n![customization](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_5.png)\\n\\n### Automation\\n\\nYou are starting to be able to create automated workflows. Not only for you, but for entire communities.\\n\\n![automation](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_6.png)\\n\\n### Notifications\\n\\nIt has notification features that can ping you similarly as if a friend sent you a message.\\n\\n![notifications](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_7.png)\\n\\n### Monetization\\n\\nYou are going to start to be able to monetize products through it.\\n\\n![monetization](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_8.png)\\n\\n### Community\\n\\nYou can use it within a server with friends/colleagues, and unlock a better user experience.\\n\\n![community](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_9.png)\\n\\n### Standardization\\n\\nThe product can work similarly on multiple chatting platforms. By keeping the same method of interaction / commands, the user is allowed to pick their favourite chatting platform or even use it in more than 1.\\n\\n![standardization](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_10.png)\\n\\n### Accessibility\\n\\nThese chatting platforms are developed for all devices and operating systems, making it a very powerful distribution system.\\n\\n![last](/blog/2023-01-05-financial-chat-bots-are-underrated-and-heres-why_11.png)\\n\\n## Why Finance?\\n\\nI\u2019ve spoke with over 100 people in the financial world in 2022. Over 50 are Bloomberg users. From those, 90% agree that their chatting feature is the most attractive feature \u2014 some of them going further and saying that that is the reason why they pay for it.\\n\\nBut what if you didn\u2019t need to pay $26 k / year for such feature. What if you could pay to have access to servers with big names in the industry? Or what if you could create your own servers? What if while you were talking with Cathie Wood about ARK performance, you could also access financial data from ARK to back up your arguments? All this while not leaving the chat.\\n\\nThis is the reason why I believe that financial chatting bots will become popular in 2023. And [OpenBB Bot](https://openbb.co/products/bot) will be leading that wave.\\n\\nTry it out for free on [OpenBB Discord server](https://openbb.co/discord) by using a command such as `/chart TSLA` and let me know what you think."},{"id":"firing-sucks-how-to-avoid-doing-so-by-hiring-a-players","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/firing-sucks-how-to-avoid-doing-so-by-hiring-a-players","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2023-01-02-firing-sucks-how-to-avoid-doing-so-by-hiring-a-players.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-02-firing-sucks-how-to-avoid-doing-so-by-hiring-a-players.md","title":"Firing sucks.

This blogpost discusses how to avoid it by hiring A players, improving the hiring process, and understanding the importance of a scorecard in recruitment.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nIn 2022, [OpenBB](http://openbb.co/) grew to 20 people. But amongst all of our hiring, we also had to let some people go.\\n\\nBefore 2022, I had never fired anyone in my life but in my new role, I had to learn how to do it. If you\u2019re a manager, you know that this is the hardest part of the job.\\n\\nHaving that said, I wanted to use my Christmas holidays to understand how we can avoid letting people go. For this, I needed to start from the beginning and improve our overall hiring process.\\n\\nThis blogpost will be highly based on the book **\u201cWho: The A Method for Hiring\u201d by Geoff Smart and Randy Street**, which I highly recommend.\\n\\n## A method for hiring\\n\\nWhat is an A player? _A candidate who has at least a 90 percent chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible candidates could achieve.\\n\\nIn this post, I will go over the steps to get an A team.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-01-02-firing-sucks-how-to-avoid-doing-so-by-hiring-a-players_1.png)\\n\\n## Scorecard\\n\\nThis is a document that describes the mission for the position, outcomes that must be accomplished, and competencies that fit with both the company culture and the role.\\n\\nThis is an example of what a scorecard should look like:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-01-02-firing-sucks-how-to-avoid-doing-so-by-hiring-a-players_2.png)\\n\\nLet\u2019s go through each of the sections in this document.\\n\\n### Mission\\n\\nThe mission is an executive summary of the job\u2019s core purpose. It boils the job down to its essence so everybody understands why you need to hire someone in this role.\\n\\nThe book talks about how you should avoid hiring a generalist. In my opinion, it depends on the stage of the company. At OpenBB, we are able to ship fast with a small team because we have a lot of generalists that are A players. However, finding a generalist A player is a much harder task than finding an A player specialist. Here, we benefit from having an open source project, since we get to build with candidates before we hire them.\\n\\n**How to:** _Develop a short statement of one to five sentences that describe why a role exists._\\n\\n### Outcomes\\n\\nDescribes what a person needs to accomplish in a role.\\n\\n> _\u201cWhile typical job descriptions break down because they focus on activities, or a list of things a person will be doing, scorecards succeed because they focus on outcomes, or what a person must get done.\u201d_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**How to:** _Develop 3 to 8 specific objective outcomes that a person must accomplish to achieve an A performance, ranked by order of importance._\\n\\n### Competencies\\n\\nDefine how you expect a new hire to operate in the fulfilment of the job and how they can achieve their objectives. What competencies really count?\\n\\n#### Ensure behavioural fit\\n\\nCritical competencies for A players are: Efficiency, honesty/integrity, organization, aggressiveness, follow-through, intelligence, analytical skills, attention to detail, persistence, proactivity.\\n\\nOthers may include: Ability to hire A players, ability to develop people, flexibility/adaptability, calm under pressure, strategic thinking/visioning, creativity/innovation, enthusiasm, work ethic, high standards, listening skills, openness. to criticism and ideas, communications, team work and persuasion.\\n\\n#### Ensure organizational fit\\n\\nEvaluating cultural fit begins with evaluating your company\u2019s values against the ones of the candidate.\\n\\nRecently, at OpenBB, I asked everyone to share with me a list of values that we currently had and they were proud of, and/or values that they would like to use instead. In a startup, where the pace is incredibly fast and the team is in constant change, I strongly believe values change over time. So I looked at everyone\u2019s inputs, and summarized them into the following OpenBB values: **Autonomy and Ownership, Innovation and Excellence, Transparent and Trustworthy, Diversity and Inclusion, Purpose and Passion, User Focused and Community Oriented.**\\n\\n**How to:** _Identify as many role-based competencies that you think are appropriate to describe the behaviors that someone must demonstrate to achieve the outcomes. Next, identify 5 to 8 competencies that describe your culture and place those on every scorecard._\\n\\n### From scorecard to strategy\\nThe beauty of a document like this is that they become the blueprint that links the theory of strategy to the reality of execution. They translate your business plans into role-by-role outcomes, create alignment among your team, unify your culture and ensure people understand your expectations.\\n\\nIn addition, they allow you to monitor employee progress over time in your annual review system and to rate your team as part of their talent review progress.\\n\\n**How to:** _Pressure-test your scorecard by comparing it with the business plan and scorecards of the people who will interface with the role. Ensure that there is consistency and alignment. Then share the scorecard with relevant parties, including peers and recruiters._\\n\\n## Source\\n\\nSystematic sourcing before you have slots to fill ensures you have high-quality candidates waiting when you need them.\\n\\n### Referrals from your professional and personal networks\\n\\nCreate a list of the ten most talented people you know and commit to speaking with at least one of them per week for the next ten weeks. At the end of each conversation ask \u201cWho are the most talented people you know?\u201d. Continue to build your list and continue to talk with at least one person per week. \u201c_Of all the ways to source candidates, the number one method is to ask for referrals from your personal and professional networks_\u201d.\\n\\n### Referrals from your employees\\n\\nAdd sourcing as an outcome on every scorecard for your team. Encourage employees to ask people in their networks. Offer a referral bonus. In-house referrals often provide better-targeted sourcing, this is because employees already know our needs and culture.\\n\\n### Deputizing friends of the firm\\n\\nConsider offering a referral bounty to select friends of the firm. It could be as inexpensive as merchandise or as expensive as a significant cash bonus. When talking with someone new at a party or a VC, always ask \u201c_who do you know who might be a good fit for my company?_\u201d\\n\\n### Sourcing system\\n\\nCreate a system that (1) captures the names and the contact information on everybody you source and (2) schedules weekly time on your calendar to follow up. Try to spend 30 minute every week sending messages or having calls with candidates from this database of A players.\\n\\n### Hiring external recruiters or hiring recruiting researchers\\n\\nThe book speaks about both, but from my experience of having an open company with an exciting mission that builds in public, these have not been relevant to us yet.\\n\\n## Select\\n\\nCreate a series of structured interviews which build on each other so you can rate your scorecard.\\n\\n### Screening Interview\\n\\nShort, phone-based interview designed to clear out B and C players from your roster of candidates.\\n\\n1. **What are your career goals?** If no goals echo your own website goals, screen them out. Ideally candidate will speak with passion and energy about their goals which are aligned with the role.\\n\\n2. **What are you really good at professionally?** Make sure that with the list of strengths, there are always examples to backup the claim. Ensure that those strengths are relevant to the competencies required in the scorecard, if not, screen them out.\\n\\n3. **What are you not good at or not interested in doing professionally?** Ignore strengths disguised as weakness. Ask again \u201cwhat are you really not good at or not interested in doing?\u201d, talented people will catch the hint. If you\u2019re still struggling to get a proper answer, put the fear of a reference check into the person \u2014 \u201cif you advance to the next step in our process, we will ask for your help in setting up some references. (\u2026) What would these references say are something things you are not good at or not interested in?\u201d\\n\\n4. **Who were your last five bosses, and what would they each rate your performance on a scale of 1\u201310 WHEN we talk to them?** The word \u2018when\u2019 is the key to unlock the truth. A rating of 7 is neutral, we are looking for 8 and above. After the rating answer always press for details.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nIf you are happy with the interview so far, conclude the call by offering the candidate an opportunity to ask questions. Otherwise just thank them for their time.\\n\\n**Tips:**\\n\\n- Always compare the person\u2019s strengths with the ones on the scorecard.\\n- When in doubt, there\u2019s no doubt. You need to have the feeling that you have found the one.\\n- Get curious: What, How, Tell me more. Keep using this framework until you are clear about what the person is really saying.\\n- Hit the gong fast. If an answer automatically rules out a candidate, just end up the interview earlier and use your precious time to focus on A players.\\n\\n### Who to Interview\\n\\nChronological walk-through of a person\u2019s career.\\n\\nYou can begin by asking about the highs and lows of a person\u2019s educational experience to gain insight into their background. After this, ask them 5 simple questions for each job they had in the past.\\n\\n#### What were you hired to do?\\n\\nYou are trying to discover what their scorecard might have been if they had one for that role. Ask them \u201chow was your success measured in the role? What was the mission and key outcomes? What competencies mattered?\u201d.\\n\\n#### What accomplishments are you most proud of?\\n\\nIdeally, candidates will tell you about accomplishments that match the job outcomes they just described to you. Even better if they match the ones of the scorecard for the position you are trying to fill.\\n\\nNote: _A players tend to talk about outcomes linked to expectations, B and C players talk generally about events, people they met, or aspects of the job they liked without ever getting into results._\\n\\n#### What were some of the low points during that job?\\n\\nPeople can be hesitant to share their lows at first. Keep reframing the question over and over until the candidate gets the message. E.g. \u201c_What went really wrong? Biggest mistake? done differently? parts you didn\u2019t like? peers stronger than you?_\u201d\\n\\n#### Who were the people you worked with?\\n\\n- **What was your boss\u2019s name and how do you spell that?**\\n\\nForcing candidates to spell the name out no matter how common it might be sends a powerful message: you are going to call, so they should tell the truth. This is referred as the \u201cthreat of reference check (TORC)\u201d.\\n\\n- **What was it like working with them?**\\n\\nIdeally, you expect high praise for their bosses and how they received mentoring and coaching from them over the years. A neutral answer will sound somewhat more reserved \u2014 not positive nor negative.\\n\\n- **What WILL they tell me about your biggest strengths and areas to improve?**\\n\\nUse \u201cwill\u201d instead of \u201cwould\u201d so candidates know you mean business, and are therefore, more likely to tell you the truth since you will learn it from reference calls anyways. Dig in as much as you can.\\n\\n- **How would you rate the team you inherited on an A, B, C scale? What changes did you make? Did you hire anybody? Fire anybody? How would you rate the team when you left it on A,B,C scale.**\\n\\nThis is applicable to managers. And allows you to understand how they approach building a strong team. Do they accept the hand they have been dealt with or do they make changes to make a better hand? What changes do they make? How long does it take?\\n\\nApply TORC here too: _\u201cWhen we speak with team members of your team, what will they say were your biggest strengths and weaknesses as manager?\u201d_\\n\\n#### Why did you leave that job?\\n\\nWas the candidate promoted, recruited or fired from each job? How did they feel about it? How did their boss react to the news? E.g. A players are highly valued by their bosses.\\n\\nGet curious. Find out why and stick with it until you have a clear picture of what actually happened.\\n\\n**Conducting an effective who interview**\\n\\n- The hiring manager should conduct this interview. They own the hire, and are the ones who will suffer the consequences of making a mistake. Their career and job happiness depend on finding A players.\\n- Conduct an interview with a colleague (e.g. someone from HR, another manager or member of your team), this allows you to focus on questions and someone else to take notes.\\n- Kick off the interview by setting expectations, e.g. _\u201cWe are going to walk through each job you have held, for each job I am going to ask you five core questions. At the end we will discuss your career goals and aspirations and you will have a chance to ask me questions. If we mutually decide to continue, we will conduct reference calls to complete the process\u201d._\\n\\n**Master tactics**\\n\\n1. **Interrupting.** You have to interrupt the candidate, there is no avoiding it. At least once every 3/4 minutes. Smile broadly, match their enthusiasm level, and use reflective listening to get them to stop talking without demoralizing them.\\n2. **The three P\u2019s.** This helps you understand how valuable an accomplishment was in any context. (1) How did the performance compare to the previous year\u2019s performance; (2) How did your performance compare to the plan?; (3) How did your performance compare to that of peers?\\n3. **Push versus Pull.** People who perform are generally pulled to greater opportunities. People who perform poorly are often pushed out of their jobs.\\n4. **Painting a picture.** You\u2019ll only understand what a candidate is saying when you can literally see a picture of it in your mind. Always try to put yourself in their shoes.\\n5. **Stopping at the Stop signs.** Look for shifts in body language and other inconsistencies. \u201cWe did great in that role\u201d while shifting in their chair, looking down and covering their mouth may be a stop sign. When that happens, get curious and understand how \u201cgreat\u201d they actually did. What was actually their contribution?\\n\\n### Focused Interview\\n\\nGetting to know more. This is NOT another Who interview. It provides the chance to invite other team member to get their opinion, but the script should be followed. Think of this interview as the \u201codds enhancer\u201d to truly focus on the outcomes and/or competencies on the scorecard.\\n\\n1. The purpose of this interview is to talk about [specific outcome or competency]\\n2. What are your biggest accomplishments in this area during your career\\n3. What are your insights into your biggest mistakes and lessons learned in this area?\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nDon\u2019t be scared to use the \u201cWhat? How? Tell me more\u201d framework until you understand what the person did and how they did it.\\n\\nFeel free to have multiple shorter focused interviews to understand particular outcome/competencies.\\n\\n**Double-check the cultural fit.** Final gauge on the cultural fit \u2014 **critical!** Include competencies and outcomes that go beyond the specifics of the job to embrace the larger values of your company.\\n\\n### Reference Interview\\n\\nTesting what you learned. Don\u2019t skip the references!\\n\\n1. Pick the right references. Review your notes from the Who interview and pick the bosses, peers, and subordinates with whom you would like to speak. Don\u2019t just use the reference list the candidate gives you.\\n2. Ask the candidate to contact the references to set up the calls. Some companies have a policy that prevents employees from serving as references, so you can increase your chances of talking with a reference if the candidate sets this up.\\n3. Conduct the right number of reference interviews. The book recommends 3 past bosses, 2 peers/customers and 2 subordinates.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**Reference interview guide:**\\n\\n1. **In what context did you work with the person?** Conversation starter and memory jogger.\\n2. **What were the person\u2019s biggest strengths?** Ask for multiple examples to put strengths and development areas into context. Don\u2019t forget to get curious by using \u201cWhat? How? Tell me more\u201d framework to clarify responses.\\n3. **What were the person\u2019s biggest areas for improvement back then?** The wording \u2018back then\u2019 liberates the reference to talk about weaknesses that existed in the past. \u201cIn truth, we believe, people don\u2019t change that much. People aren\u2019t mutual funds. Past performance really is an indicator of future performance.\u201d\\n4. **How would you rate their overall performance in that job on a 1\u201310 scale?** What about their performance causes you to give that rating? Remember that 6 is really a 2. How does this rating compare with what the candidate said in advance? Wide discrepancy is alarming.\\n5. **The person mentioned that they struggled with ____ on that job. Can you talk more about that?** Test something the candidate told you by framing it as a question for the reference. E.g. \u201cthe person mentioned that you MIGHT SAY he was disorganized. Can you tell me more about that?\u201d the wording is again very important as \u2018might say\u2019 suggests to the reference that they have permission to talk about the subject because the candidate raised it.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThese questions follow the same pattern as the other interviews. This makes it very easy to merge what you hear with what you have already learned about a candidate.\\n\\n**Tips:**\\n\\n- **Avoid accepting a candidate\u2019s reference list at face value.** E.g. either use your own network for gathering objective unbiased data or try to reach out to subordinates or people two levels below who interacted with the candidate to get a more honest answer.\\n- **Hearing or understanding the code for risky candidates.** Be able to read between lines. People don\u2019t like to give negative reference, so your best defense is to pay close attention to what people say and how they say it. Examples of bad signs: If they just confirm dates of employment, um\u2019s and er\u2019s is hesitation, absence of enthusiasm (faint praise).\\n\\n### Decide who to hire\\n\\n**Skill-Will Bull\u2019s Eye**\\n\\nDoes somebody\u2019s skill (what they can do) and will (what they want to do) match your scorecard? This is a person\u2019s skill-will profile.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-01-02-firing-sucks-how-to-avoid-doing-so-by-hiring-a-players_3.png)\\n\\nYou should have plenty of data at this stage to make this assessment.\\n\\n- **Skill has to do with a candidate\u2019s ability to achieve the individual outcomes on your scorecard.** If you believe a candidate has a 90% or better chance to achieve a certain outcome based on the data gathered, rate them an A, otherwise a B or a C. Repeat for each outcome.\\n- **Will has to do with the motivations and competencies a candidate brings to the table.** For each competency, does the data suggest there is a 90% or better chance that the candidate will display that competency? If so rate them an A, otherwise a B or C. Repeat for each competency.\\n\\nAn A player is someone whose skill and will match your scorecard. Anything less is a B or C, no matter the experience or seeming talent level.\\n\\n**Red Flags: When to dive beneath the surface**\\n\\nThese flags may not be deal killers, but they are likely to signal that there is something worth exploring beneath the surface:\\n\\n- Does not mention past failures\\n- Exaggerates their answers\\n- Takes credit for the work of others\\n- Speaks poorly of past bosses\\n- Cannot explain job moves\\n- People most important to the candidate are unsupportive of a change\\n- For managerial hires, never had to hire or fire anybody\\n- Seems more interested in compensation and benefits than in the job itself\\n- Tries too hard to look like an expert\\n- Self-absorbed\\n\\nMore behavioral warning signs:\\n\\n- Winning too much\\n- Adding too much value\\n- Starting a sentence with \u2018no\u2019, \u2018but\u2019, or \u2018however\u2019\\n- Telling the world how smart we are\\n- Making destructive comments about previous colleagues\\n- Blaming others\\n- Making excuses\\n- The excessive need to \u2018be me\u2019\\n\\n**How to decide:**\\n\\n1. Take out your scorecards that you have completed on each candidate\\n2. Make sure you have rated all of the candidates on the scorecard. If you have not given each candidate an overall A, B or C grade, do so now. Make any updates you need to based on the reference interviews. Look at the data, consider the opinions and observations of the interview team, and give a final grade.\\n3. If you have no A\u2019s, then restart your process and the second step: source.\\n4. If you have one A, decide to hire that person.\\n5. If you have multiple A\u2019s, then rank them and decide to hire the best A among them.\\n\\n## Sell\\n\\nOnce candidates pass the selection, persuade them to join. The key to successfully selling your candidate to your company is putting yourself in their shoes.\\n\\n### Five F\u2019s of selling\\n\\nThere are 5 areas that candidates tend to care about, make sure to address each of these 5 areas until you get the person onboard.\\n\\n1. **Selling Fit:** This ties together the company\u2019s vision, needs and culture with the candidate\u2019s goals, strengths and values.\\n2. **Selling Family:** Takes into account the broader trauma of changing jobs.\\n3. **Selling Freedom:** The autonomy the candidate will have to make their own decisions.\\n4. **Selling Fortune:** Reflects the stability of your company and the overall financial upside.\\n5. **Selling Fun:** Describes the work environment and personal relationships the candidate will make.\\n\\n### Five waves of selling\\n\\nSelling should be something that happens throughout the entire hiring process. In particular, there are five distinct phases that merit increased selling effort:\\n\\n1. When you source\\n2. When you interview\\n3. The time between your offer and the candidate acceptance\\n4. The time between the candidate\u2019s acceptance and their first day\\n5. The new hire\u2019s first one hundred days on the job\\n\\n### Persistent pays off\\n\\nOnce you have identified the right candidate, you must be persistent and do whatever you can to sign the deal.\\n\\n### How to: sell A Players\\n\\n1. Identify which of the five F\u2019s really matter to the candidate.\\n2. Create and execute a plan to address the relevant F\u2019s during the five waves of selling.\\n3. Be persistent. Don\u2019t give up until you have your A player on board.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn a more simplistic image, this is what the A method boils down too.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2023-01-02-firing-sucks-how-to-avoid-doing-so-by-hiring-a-players_4.png)\\n\\nI really enjoyed reading this book and I am taking a lot of these learnings to improve the hiring processes at OpenBB."},{"id":"how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2022-12-11-how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-11-how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster.md","title":"How ChatGPT allowed me to leverage Twitter API 10x faster","description":"Leveraging the power of ChatGPT to interact with Twitter API for real-time financial news updates.","date":"2022-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"chatgpt","permalink":"/blog/tags/chatgpt"},{"inline":true,"label":"twitter-api","permalink":"/blog/tags/twitter-api"},{"inline":true,"label":"tweepy","permalink":"/blog/tags/tweepy"},{"inline":true,"label":"python","permalink":"/blog/tags/python"},{"inline":true,"label":"programming","permalink":"/blog/tags/programming"}],"readingTime":3.09,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster","title":"How ChatGPT allowed me to leverage Twitter API 10x faster","date":"2022-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2022-12-11-how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster.png","tags":["chatgpt","twitter-api","tweepy","python","programming"],"description":"Leveraging the power of ChatGPT to interact with Twitter API for real-time financial news updates."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Firing sucks.

In particular, accounts that have up-to-date information and usually mention the words \u201cJUST IN\u201d or \u201cBREAKING\u201d. E.g. [@WatcherGuru](https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru) or [@unusual_whales](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales).\\n\\nBy doing this, I could then use the bottom of the OpenBB Terminal to highlight the news. An example of this is below:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-11-how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster_2.png)\\n\\n## Coding and ChatGPT\\n\\nThe next step for me was to implement the code!\\n\\nFirst, I needed to understand how I could have access to the last tweet of a specific user account. I already had a Twitter API account created, which meant I already had the key, token and secrets, therefore, I just needed to read documentation to understand how to use the Twitter API. Hence, I started reading [Twitter\u2019s developer documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/api-reference/get-tweets-search-recent).\\n\\nThe day before I had been playing around with ChatGPT. And like everyone else, I was very impressed. One of the things that surprised me the most was how good it was at outputting working code with an explanation along the lines.\\n\\nSo, while I was reading the documentation, I was thinking \u201cI wish there was a way for me to just be able to get the last N tweets of an account without needing to dig in the developer documentation\u201d. Could ChatGPT be the answer?\\n\\nSo I tried\u2026\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-11-how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster_3.png)\\n\\nThis was already amazing. But I\u2019m lazy and didn\u2019t want to copy all the cells individually to put it into a Jupyter notebook, so asked ChatGPT to provide the code output as a single block. I wasn\u2019t convinced it was going to work. **But it did**.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-11-how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster_4.png)\\n\\n\u2026 it just worked. \ud83e\udd2f\\n\\nAfter that, I needed the timestamp associated with the tweet, to see how old it was. As usual, I started looking into [Tweepy documentation](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/authentication.html#twitter-api-v2).\\n\\n**Ups, what was I doing again?**\\n\\nAfter a couple of seconds, I went onto ChatGPT and asked how I could get the timestamp of a tweet using Tweepy library.\\n\\n**And \ud83e\ude84, it worked again!!!**\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-11-how-chatgpt-allowed-me-to-leverage-twitter-api-10x-faster_5.png)\\n\\nOne thing that is for sure: ChatGPT is going to truly disrupt many industries.

But since I was working at a startup in the UK, I had a 3 month notice period.\\n\\nDuring that time I worked on documenting pretty much everything I had been working on, BUT that felt short. I felt like the data that came out of our [NURVV Run](http://www.nurvv.com/) product could be used with a machine learning algorithm in order to detect a foot strike quite efficiently.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_1.png)\\n\\nSo I asked my company:\\n\\n> _If I use my spare time to work on this paper will you sponsor me if I get accepted?_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**My goal was to increase the visibility of our product in academia.** And given I spent some time reading papers in the area, I knew that what I had in mind had a shot at working.\\n\\n**My background is not data science, and this was my first time \u201cofficially\u201d working on machine learning.** I wasn\u2019t 100% sure that my idea would work, but after spending more than 1 year at the company, I knew how the data behaved. I thought I could build an algorithm robust enough to be able to detect a foot strike more efficiently than what others had.\\n\\nAfter some time, the company accepted my proposal, and between the time to decide to apply to [International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)](https://www.icmla-conference.org/icmla21/) and getting ready to start working on the paper, there was 1 week left.\\n\\nI thought that this window was rather tight given that I had to clean the data, work on the entire code behind the paper from idea to implementation, and write the damn paper. **I knew this was gonna be tight, but oh boy.** I had one of the harshest weeks of my life. I barely slept for 7 straight days, and skipped the company team event in order to make it through the deadline.\\n\\nBecause of that, I will go into what happened at each step along the way with images. I will skip the cleaning data and boring parts, don\u2019t worry. If you just want to read the final paper, you can find it here: [\u201dStep Detection using SVM on NURVV Trackers\u201d](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9680024).\\n\\nAlso, if you\u2019ve been following me, you know how much I love open source. Owing to that I open source the code behind the project [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/step-detection-ML).\\n\\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\\n\\nThe Nurvv trackers have an **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) tracks linear acceleration (accelerometer) and rotational rate (gyroscope)**. Sometimes it also contains a magnetometer. And Nurvv gave me access to 6 runs from 6 different runners.\\n\\nMy first step was to look into how this data looked. On the left you can see the acceleration (m/s\xb2) and the angular velocity (rad/s).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_2.png)\\n\\nI knew that our **IMU had a sampling rate of 1125 Hz** (which means that each data point gets sampled at approximately every 888.89\u03bcs) and **this was critical in order to detect the oscillations that occur when a foot strike occurs** (i.e. impact of the foot on the floor makes the IMU oscillate). Thus I zoomed in the zone of impact and used a scatter plot to understand if we were \u201cmissing\u201d information.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_3.png)\\n\\nI found it interesting that **the distance between the samples were larger at the time of the impact**. So I plotted the IMU accelerometer data and the IMU gyroscope data in a 3D plot interactively as a function of time (below you can see a snapshot).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_4.png)\\n\\nFrom here it was interesting to note that when the foot is in the air, the samples are somehow concentrated (darker blue), whereas when a step occurs (more sparse) they behave erratically. The plot above was snapshotted with 3 steps that occurred.\\n\\nFrom that 3D plot I had the intuition that by utilizing a **principal component analysis (PCA**)**, I could reduce the dimensionality without losing much information. The result is shown below,\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_5.png)\\n\\nThis made me think that I could use a **support vector machine (SVM)** in order to detect whether a foot strike has occurred or not. And what I was most excited about it was:\\n\\n- **This model isn\u2019t time-dependant.** Meaning that it would be fascinating to be able to predict whether a step occurred or not without the notion of time, but the current IMU data.\\n- We can develop an SVM model for each runner style. Then create an **ensemble model with hard voting** which allowed for the model that has seen more similar data, to be more confident in the classification of foot strike vs not foot strike.\\n\\nBut this was all a theory, I needed to prove it.\\n\\nThe first issue I had was: **SVM is a supervised learning model**. This meant that for the sampling data I was providing the model, I would have to classify whether those samples corresponded to a foot strike or not.\\n\\n**The issue?** Although the product had **force sensitive resistors (FSR)** in the insoles, I didn\u2019t have access to the samples that corresponded with these IMU samples.\\n\\nSo I knew that I would have to classify the data myself. Manually would have been a nightmare and not reliable enough, so I needed to build an algorithm that could classify the data quite reliably. **Signal processing theory, here I go.**\\n\\n### Labelling data for a supervised learning problem\\n\\n1. Get the raw IMU samples (accelerometer and gyroscope)\\n2. Do the difference in magnitude between the accelerometers samples and then the gyroscope samples\\n3. Apply root sum squared to the magnitude difference of accelerometer data, and then similarly to gyroscope data\\n4. Standardize the accelerometer data and the gyroscope data. This is so the data can be somehow compared with each other since the magnitude varies as one represents linear acceleration and the other angular rate.\\n5. Do the average between these 2 signals. This makes the data more robust.\\n6. Finally, apply a convolution to the resulting signal with a rectangular pulse. This allows to remove \u201cdrops\u201d from the signal and ensures a smoother signal.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nBelow you can see the formulas and signal changes that were made in order to obtain the final result:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_6.png)\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_7.png)\\n\\nAfter this, I selected a sensible value of 0.3 to be used as a threshold on the resulting signal to classify step vs no-step.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_8.png)\\n\\nI applied the difference between each first foot strike detected in order to make sure that there was no missed step. As you can see above the stride time is around 700ms which is what is expected of a runner jogging.\\n\\nSomeone might be wondering; If this gives such a great result, why did I need machine learning in the first place? **The reason is because standardization and convolution (steps 4 and steps 6) are a post-processing signal technique.** Therefore, it cannot be deployed in running time, and relies on data that happens in the future.\\n\\nFor illustration purposes, here is how the initial raw IMU data behaves against the labelling from signal processing approach (red background means no step, while green background means step).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_9.png)\\n\\n## Support Vector Machine for classification\\n\\nFor the model, SVM was selected because:\\n\\n- It works well with high dimensional data (6 IMU samples) because it only uses a few of these points (called support vectors) to create this hyperplane (decision boundary) between classes.\\n- SVM is ideal for binary classification problems.\\n- RBF kernel allows to handle non-linear data.\\n\\nThis is the type of classification that SVM is capable of (this is the raw acceleration data with a PCA applied, and the SVM classification on the background for a model that was trained using that same data).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_10.png)\\n\\n### C and gamma hyperparameters\\n\\n- Given each dataset is rather large to perform **grid search optimization** on C and gamma, a subset of each of the datasets is used to extract these parameters.\\n- Each dataset subset is now split: 80% for training data and 20% for validation.\\n- Thus, 80% of the data subset is used to apply SVM with different combinations of C and gamma over a 2D grid. The remaining 20% is used to test the logistic loss and assess optimal hyperparameters.\\n\\n### Training and testing\\n\\n- 80% of data is used for training and 20% is used for testing.\\n- Although the testing is done **out-of-sample**, given the nature of the data (where it comes from the same distribution) it is almost as if it was an **in-sample**.\\n- In our case this is ideal as we want each model to perform very well on its own dataset. We want each model to generalize well for that very specific type of data (runner style, speed and terrain).\\n- A 5-sample moving average is applied before assessing the classification of our model, this is to remove spurious samples. A small window needs to be selected to not introduce a delay in the recognition of a step.\\n- Since our data set is imbalanced (i.e. there are more samples being no-step than step samples) we\u2019ll use **Geometric Mean (G-Mean) evaluation score**, since this measure tries to maximize the accuracy on each of the classes while keeping their accuracies balanced.\\n\\n### Result\\n\\nIn the same dataset where we trained our SVM, we were able to achieve a G-Mean of 0.9645. This is rather expected since this is a powerful model and it was trained on that same data.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_11.png)\\n\\nFrom the graph above this result is very positive given that the mislabelling always occurs at the boundary of a step / no-step detection. And since the sampling occurs very fast, we have some margin of error.\\n\\n## Ensemble SVM model architecture\\n\\nThis model as expected had a poor performance in an unseen dataset. This is normal as the data came from a different runner, running at a different speed in a different terrain. Thus, in order to create a more robust model, we built this ensemble SVM model architecture.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_12.png)\\n\\nEach dataset has the signal processing technique applied in order to obtain the labelling. With this labels, an SVM model can be trained.\\n\\nThen, an **unseen dataset** (not used for training) will be used as input for all the trained SVM models. I.e. each input (3 accelerometer samples and 3 gyroscope samples) will be given to each SVM model which will output 0 or 1 to denote no-step or step, respectively.\\n\\nMy rationale there was: _I could do a major voting approach, BUT because of how I trained the data. It could happen that one of the models had the sample being very inside the boundary, whereas 2 others had it just outside, and the later would win. This is not what I was looking for._\\n\\nBecause of this boundary approach associated with SVMs, I knew that although SVM doesn\u2019t provide probability estimates directly, these could be calculated. So I took advantage of that. And used that probability estimate to select whether the input was considered a stop or not. My rationale was: the model that has seen more similar IMU samples is likely to have a higher confidence in their output and as output they will have what I provided as a label in advance.\\n\\nFinally, I applied a **5-sample moving average** to the step (1) / no-step (0) output and round the value to be classified as step and no-step. This allowed to remove spurious samples.\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nThe prediction for a single SVM was extremely accurate because the model was trained on data samples from that same run (i.e. distribution). On the other hand, the ensemble prediction didn\u2019t run on data from that distribution, hence, making this problem much more complex. However, even with that constraint, a G-Mean of 0.8756 was still achieved.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-12-07-how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla_13.png)\\n\\n## Future work\\n\\n- Employ the data coming from the \u201dsmart\u201d insoles as an alternative ground-truth for determining step versus no-step conditions.\\n- The diversity of the data set can also be expanded to account for more surfaces, running speeds and styles.\\n- Explore whether the characteristics of the PCA plot of IMU data can be used to categorize different running styles.\\n- The exploration of different classification algorithms for the step detection problem, e.g. applying a long-short term memory (LTSM) neural network algorithm to exploit the time-dependency between samples.\\n- Implement this proof-of-concept code on the production NURVV Run system, to test the prediction technique in a real-life scenario and consider computational time.\\n\\n## Final remarks\\n\\nThis was my first most technical blogpost where I went into details in how I wrote a ML paper that was accepted in a major conference in 1 week. Would love to know your thoughts on it.\\n\\nFeel free to check the full paper version here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9680024"},{"id":"the-future-of-finance-with-open-source-and-ai","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-future-of-finance-with-open-source-and-ai","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2022-12-04-the-future-of-finance-with-open-source-and-ai.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-04-the-future-of-finance-with-open-source-and-ai.md","title":"The future of finance with open source and AI","description":"The future of finance is being reshaped by open source and AI.

There are dozens of different asset classes (stocks, options, crypto, NFTs, currencies, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, \u2026) and these often vary based on geography. **That makes the overall investment research industry a very tough market to compete.** Startups cannot disrupt the space without a massive capital injection. This is also why startups usually focus on a certain asset class in a certain geography.\\n\\n**In my opinion, the only shot we have to disrupt incumbents is by not owning the data but becoming the infra layer between data sources and users.** _This is no different than Uber not owning cars, Airbnb not owning apartments or Deliveroo not owning restaurants._\\n\\n**This also has a great advantage which is being able to integrate new data sources very fast and easily.** Plus, owing to open source, anyone can add it. On the other hand, it\u2019s very unlikely that an incumbent will add data that you require. Plus, if they do, they will need to license the data and therefore decrease their margins \u2014 unless they increase the price to users.\\n\\n### Full-price bundle\\n\\nCurrent incumbents pricing is usually a complete bundled offering. **This means that regardless of what you are utilizing in terms of both breadth and depth, you pay the full price tag.** A good analogy is like a restaurant ONLY having a buffet when all you want is a bottle of water, or some chips. What happens is that a user ends up paying for data that they are not using.\\n\\nIn 2022, this is a very outdated take. Companies are looking to get leaner, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to pay for data that you aren\u2019t going to leverage. **Being the infrastructure between users and data sources allows you to create value to both**; Since users will have access to all the data they want and pay for the ones they use, and data sources will have access to a big pool of users and may not need to create a dashboard product to monetize their offerings.\\n\\n### Transparency & Customization\\n\\nCurrent incumbents have built several in-house financial models. **Although these are often customizable, their customization is typically limited.** That is because what is usually customizable are the values/weights, but not necessarily the formulas \u2014 that is kept hidden in their source code. This is an issue because that code cannot be validated and users cannot modify it.\\n\\nWith open source, the story is completely different. **Users can see every single line of code, and therefore not only audit the code quality but adapt the models/formulas to their own needs.** At the end of the day, there is no point in re-inventing the wheel for financial theory that has been around for decades.\\n\\nBy having the code open source, users can rely on the fact that these formulas have been validated/tested by thousands or millions of users and, therefore, there\u2019s a very low chance that these are wrong. **In addition, users are more secure because they can investigate the code and check/fix any vulnerabilities.**\\n\\n### Community\\n\\nOne of the best parts of open source is the integrated community that it creates. This attracts people from every background, gender or ethnicity. Such a pool of diversity tends to allow for better ideas and pushes a project further. With people from the community being able to contribute, this also drives innovation.\\n\\n[OpenBB](http://my.openbb.co/app/terminal/community-routines) has been driven a lot by the community so far. What started as a terminal mostly focused on stocks, soon evolved into including a broad range of datasets and considering several geographies. E.g. A contributor from Sweeden integrated Avanza API to the mutual funds menu that would only appear if users were looking into mutual funds from Sweden. This shows the power of community.\\n\\nHaving the platform be _open source_ is key.\\n\\n## GPT as the interface\\n\\n**One of the hedges that incumbents have is the fact that they have been around for a very long time and spent a lot on educating users about their product.** As a result, users are used to their platform. This makes them harder to switch to an unknown product. This is also why a product needs to be 10x better than competition for users to switch.\\n\\n**However, what if there was no learning curve?** What if you could use a product for the first time and knew how to access all the data without spending any time reading the documentation. **In essence, the educational incumbent advantage would become obsolete.**\\n\\nWith the new LLM advancements, such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). We are not far from this reality.\\n\\n![cool1](/blog/2022-12-04-the-future-of-finance-with-open-source-and-ai_2.png)\\n\\nPlus, if this is built on top of an open source project it means that the **community can help in improving the model** by providing more training data (e.g. provide a text as input and the corresponding command as output) or even confirm whether or not the chart that pops up was accurate.

The startup\'s product focuses on smart running insoles with lightweight trackers that fit any running shoes.\\n\\nThe company was small, and the firmware team was myself and 2 Senior Embedded Firmware Engineers.\\n\\nWhat I liked the most about this team was that our interests complemented each other very well. One of the Senior Embedded Firmware Engineers was very strong at wireless communications (BLE, ANT) while the other was great at communication protocols (SPI, I2C). On my end, my strength was from my MSc in Control Systems and my past experience with GNSS. In addition, I had a very high interest in learning about Inertial Navigation System (INS). My goal was to become a Sensor Fusion Engineer.\\n\\nSo what did I do to become a Sensor Fusion Engineer?\\n\\n## Declare your intent\\n\\nSince day 1 in the company, my team lead knew that my goal was to become a Sensor Fusion Engineer.\\n\\nThis is very important, as your manager can keep this in the back of their mind when assigning tasks to you. For instance, my team lead was giving me a lot of material around the way our product processed external samples as this was critical to the INS.\\n\\n## Define a roadmap\\n\\nI asked my manager: \\"What do I need to do to be recognized as a Sensor Fusion Engineer\\".\\n\\nKnowing about the matter is not enough, you want to have the credentials so that you can jump faster in your career.\\n\\nMy team lead was not aware of the capabilities I would need to have to become a Sensor Fusion Engineer, so he spent quite some time doing due diligence on this. Good managers will go out of their way to help you grow.\\n\\nAfter some time, we discussed what I would need to do at the company to be recognized as Sensor Fusion Engineer and built a roadmap in order to get there.\\n\\n## Work hard\\n\\nWork extremely hard towards that roadmap.\\n\\nI was not only working towards that roadmap, but I was also working towards it at 2.5x the average speed. I was working 80h \u2014 100h / weeks during that time.\\n\\nI was being pulled into all meetings that discussed sensor fusion, I was reading old documentation to understand the decisions that I made, I was reading codebase and questioning all code (which allowed me to find some issues) and I was taking online courses on top of this.\\n\\nMore importantly, I was experimenting with the product. Theory will only help you so much, you need to get your hands dirty or you will never be able to fully master a skill.\\n\\n## Frequently revise your roadmap\\n\\nThroughout all my 1:1 with my manager, we always revisited the roadmap \u2014 even if briefly. This made sure that he knew how serious I was about this topic, and allowed me to demonstrate my progress.\\n\\nThis also allowed myself to look back and realize my own progress. I would spend time educating him on what I had learned and how we could apply that in our product, including some simulations I had done in Python.\\n\\n## Prove yourself\\n\\nDon\'t miss an opportunity to prove yourself.\\n\\nThis is the most critical point, you need to prove that you are capable of delivering by actually demonstrating a real example.\\n\\nThis is the egg or chicken first problem. When you don\'t have the initial experience, your company won\'t trust you to apply your knowledge. But if your company doesn\'t give you the chance you will never get the experience.\\n\\nIn our case, users started getting weird jumps in altitude reported by the trackers. And we needed to figure out the issue fast as this was increasing the churn. I immediately knew I was able to solve this, and knew I had to grab this opportunity.\\n\\nOur trackers were not taking the GPS location in the estimation of user altitude, and I knew that considering that would substantially improve the estimation as the altitude has less chances to change drastically over a small distance.\\n\\nFinally, my degree and hundreds of hours of work were paying off. That day, I wrote our C/C++ altitude estimation algorithm in Python and provided with an input that had a spurious jump in pressure readings \u2014 i.e. I recreated how the issue was happening.\\n\\nI proceeded to implement a Kalman Filter solution to consider GPS readings as well, and the result was a massive improvement. The jump in altitude was non-existant now.\\n\\nIn the daily standup the next day, I had accomplished most of my tasks for the sprint and asked the product owner if I could take a shot at fixing the altitude issue. He was a bit hesitant, but I had a notebook ready to show the problem recreated and my proposed solution in Python.\\n\\nHe accepted and gave me the next 3 days to work on it and to present results on Monday. I didn\'t sleep until that Monday. Implementing from Python to C++ was the easy part. The hard part was debugging + optimizing the weights of the Kalman Filter.\\n\\nI was touching the code. Performing an over the air upgrade. Going outside for a run in a track with a bridge where I knew the altitude. Analyzing results at home. Iterate.\\n\\nMonday arrived and I presented results, and they looked so much better. The proposed solution was accepted. Our INS algorithm hadn\'t changed in a long time, so a lot of testing was needed.\\n\\nAfter that, the company accepted to offer me the title of Sensor Fusion engineer. Without a pay rise, but that was fine as for me it was about speeding up my career.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n- Declare intent\\n- Define roadmap\\n- Work towards that roadmap\\n- Frequently revise roadmap\\n- Don\'t miss an opportunity to prove yourself\\n\\n**Note:** If the company doesn\'t give you a chance to prove yourself, you should interview for that position with other companies. And if another company offers you that job, you will have the leverage that another company perceives you as that.\\n\\nI like [this video](https://youtube.com/shorts/x71Rm0MWVHY?si=BvtmjrE31d6U1bpV) about understanding your market value. And I think it can be extended in terms of your skillset if you want to change your role.\\n\\nFeedback as always is welcome :)"},{"id":"how-to-grow-your-open-source-community-from-scratch.md","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-grow-your-open-source-community-from-scratch.md","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2022-11-10-how-to-grow-your-open-source-community-from-scratch.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-10-how-to-grow-your-open-source-community-from-scratch.md","title":"How to grow your open source community from scratch","description":"Growing an open source community from scratch is a challenging task.

This blogpost shares insights and strategies on how to effectively build and manage an open source community, using the example of the OpenBB Terminal project.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\n### Project naming\\n\\nThe name should be short, memorable, unique and related with the project.\\n\\nWhen I started what we call OpenBB Terminal today, the name of the project was \u201cStock Market Bot\u201d or something silly like that. I knew that wouldn\u2019t be the last name, but I didn\u2019t have any inspiration and in the meantime I was focused on building the platform.\\n\\nI am an Elon Musk fan, and was a GameStop investor. This meant that once I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703) \u2014 I didn\u2019t blink twice and knew this was the name I was waiting for.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-11-10-how-to-grow-your-open-source-community-from-scratch.png)\\n\\nThat\u2019s when Gamestonk Terminal (now OpenBB Terminal) was born.\\n\\n### Keep the project private until MVP\\n\\n- There will be less pressure than building in public, and you will be able to iterate much faster.\\n- No users asking for features or reporting bugs when MVP is still under development.\\n- Most importantly, this guarantees that when the users see the MVP they know where you are heading with the project.\\n\\nI worked on Gamestonk Terminal for 2 months on my own. The code architecture changed several times as I was in this experimental phase. And if you look into the source code I even committed API keys accidentally. But I had no pressure, so I was able to ship extremely fast.\\n\\n### Prepare to onboard the community\\n\\n- Make the documentation standout (not only \u201cgetting started\u201d but also \u201ccontributing\u201d).\\n- Create \u201cquick win\u201d tickets that the community can address quickly.\\n- Start a group channel on Discord or Slack, which allows you to interact with contributors and discuss features / roadmap and keep them engaged.\\n- Mention \u201cstarring\u201d the project. As simple as this sounds, this helps with growth as its easy to forget to star the project, even though you were interested in what you saw.\\n\\nSome people from our current team told me recently that they fell in love with the README of the project the first time they saw it. In particular with this quote:\\n\\n> _\u201cGamestonk Terminal is an awesome stock and crypto market terminal that has been developed for fun, while I saw my GME shares tanking. But hey, I like the stock.\u201d_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis allowed me to gain not only contributors, but maintainers. And nowadays, team members.\\n\\n### Change the project visibility to public\\n\\n- This allows everyone to have a first look into the project, it\u2019s the \u201cHello World\u201d moment.\\n- When sharing the project, describe the problem you are trying to solve and make sure your audience relates with that problem.\\n- Share your project on relevant channels (e.g. Reddit, HackerNews, ProductHunt) \u2014 where your audience is.\\n\\nI have been building in open source for a while, without much success. Until Gamestonk Terminal.\\n\\nThe difference? I shared Gamestonk Terminal on:\\n\\n- Reddit r/SuperStonk \u2014 where the retail traders with the same issue as me were gathered\\n- Reddit r/python \u2014 where the community shares projects built in python\\n- HackerNews \u2014 where I leveraged the name of a known brand in the same industry and insinuated that my tool was similar but affordable. The title was: \u201c[Can\u2019t afford Bloomberg Terminal? No prob, I built the next best thing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26258773)\u201d.\\n\\n### Keep developing in public\\n\\n- Keep the community updated on the roadmap and progress. You can do this by doing demos of what you have accomplished as you add new features (e.g. [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqGPK8OVHLk) or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/didier_lopes/status/1567117888590340098)) which allows the community to understand what sort of tasks you are working on, and what they would learn if they were to contribute. It basically gives the community a hindsight into what a contributor will be able to work on / achieve.\\n- Get early feedback and prioritise accordingly.\\n- Occasionally go back to the same channels (e.g. Reddit, Hackernews) to report progress. This guarantees that they know the project is not dead and helps your project staying relevant and on their minds.\\n- Develop in public through livestreams (e.g. [live Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BMI9cleTTg)) or by sharing what you are working on through social media (e.g. [adding a futures menu](https://twitter.com/didier_lopes/status/1579414220256387072)).\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nTL;DR: On how to grow your open source project:\\n\\n- Project naming\\n- Keep project private until MVP\\n- Prepare to onboard the community\\n- Change the project visibility to public\\n- Keep developing in public"},{"id":"how-to-learn-10x-faster-than-average","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-to-learn-10x-faster-than-average","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2022-10-27-how-to-learn-10x-faster-than-average.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-27-how-to-learn-10x-faster-than-average.md","title":"How to learn 10x faster than average","description":"Learn how to accelerate your learning process and become 10x faster than average.

But people\u2019s rhythm of self learning can be vastly different.\\n\\n### Have a good reason to learn this new skill\\n\\nWhat is the main fundamental reason why you want to learn this skill? If you don\u2019t have a one sentence answer, you probably don\u2019t need to learn it.\\n\\nUniversity teaches you hundreds of topics that you end up not being good at because you have no interest in it.\\n\\nAvoid spending your precious time on developing a skill that you have no interest or purpose in. Avoid trends too for this reason.\\n\\n### Research and read about the best way to learn the basics\\n\\nThis should take no longer than one afternoon. Avoid promoted content.\\n\\nUsually, you\u2019re able to find a course/book/video that is acclaimed by the community to be the best to get started with.\\n\\nSo we are looking for the equivalent of \u201cMachine Learning from Andrew Ng\u201d for the skill you want to master.\\n\\n### Consume the basics like your life depends on it\\n\\nThis will be the foundation of all your subsequent learning in this new area. Put your phone away, and take notes.\\n\\nRevisit those notes, and if necessary go back in time to understand the basics.\\n\\nIt took me above average time to finish Machine Learning from Andrew Ng.\\n\\nHowever, since this, whenever I learn or even think about AI problems this is now easier because of that laid out work.\\n\\n### Test your knowledge with a real problem (aka get your hands dirty)\\n\\nAnd no, I don\u2019t mean do an exercise that you find online.\\n\\nDefine a problem that you can solve with the skills you acquired and work on it.\\n\\nDon\u2019t ask for the answer. Don\u2019t Google for the solution, but Google for something that is a current impediment on your solution.\\n\\nIf you are struggling on formulating the Google prompt, revisit your first notes on the skill.\\n\\n### Keep learning about the topic\\n\\nThe getting started foundation will only get you so far. It\u2019s likely that soon you will grow out of that and need to expand your knowledge.\\n\\nDon\u2019t jump on this step too early. Make sure your basics are covered before you move on.\\n\\nGo back to the real problem you worked on, and see how the new learned skills could be applied for that same problem.\\n\\nIf those skills aren\u2019t necessarily in that first problem, it\u2019s also a good sign. It\u2019s a sign that you learned not only the skill but when it is and it isn\u2019t used.\\n\\n### Iterate\\n\\nKeep iterating between using this new skill to solve a real problem and learning from courses/videos/books.\\n\\nThere isn\u2019t a \u201cyou made it\u201d badge. But you know you did, once you\u2019re able to look for a specific piece of information on a video/book to fill in the gap for something you needed for your real problem.\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nTL;DR on how to learn 10x faster than average\\n\\n1. Have a good reason to learn this new skill.\\n2. Research and read about the best way to learn the basics.\\n3. Consume the basics like your life depended on it.\\n4.

E.g. https://github.com/DidierRLopes\\n\\nIn my humble opinion, this isn\u2019t being talked enough. Previously, you needed a CV document to talk about your background, education, previous jobs and could rely on your GitHub profile to show your projects. With this update, CVs have become obsolete. When hiring for [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/), I put a lot of weight into the public GitHub of each engineer.\\n\\nThis is my current [GitHub profile page](https://github.com/DidierRLopes).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-10-15-stop-doing-your-cv-in-word-or-latex_1.png)\\n\\nMy profile page is now much simpler since I\u2019ve worked on my [own personal website](https://didierrlopes.github.io/personal-website/), but you can see [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/DidierRLopes/tree/98c27cfb087fc8ce6986f4ea8136e76ca14f145b) what my GitHub profile page looked like before. Creating your own personalized website for me is the next step after GitHub, as you can be as creative as you want while showing off your coding skills.\\n\\nMy repository is my way of showing the world what I can do on my own. From a blank sheet to a finalized project. **Sometimes useful, sometimes for fun, but always with the intention to learn more and challenge myself.**\\n\\nThe reason I think that GitHub profile\u2019s are the CVs of the future for engineers/developers, is not only because you can now both talk about yourself in it and display your portfolio, but because of its open source nature.\\n\\nWith products like: https://ossinsight.io/analyze/DidierRLopes, you will be able to dive deeper on engineering skills than ever before.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-10-15-stop-doing-your-cv-in-word-or-latex_2.png)\\n\\nCompanies will be able to assess a candidate based on their open source work:\\n\\n- How do they interact with the community? What are their communication skills?\\n- Do they practice teamwork? And mentor more junior developers?\\n- Are they leaving comments in the code? Is their code readable in the first place?\\n- What about testing? Are they following good practices?\\n- What\u2019s their time to reply to issues? Or to review PRs from peers?\\n- Activity? What are their working hour patterns like?\\n- \u2026\\n\\nImagine a world where everyone develops in the wild. You can see everything and be part of any project. You have your own profile, you talk with others through issues or PRs, you build together.

This is still an unofficial wrapper. As you can see from Yahoo Finance website, it uses an ad revenue business model. This means that Yahoo Finance doesn\u2019t has any incentive from having users utilizing it through Yfinance API.\\n\\nIf one day Yahoo Finance website adds a paywall through an API key, then Yahoo Finance would:\\n\\n1. Either become obsolete\\n2. Or adopt the same architecture of OpenBB where an API key from a data source is necessary\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nRegardless, Yfinance API retrieves data that exists on a third-party website: Yahoo Finance website. This means that this API is limited by the data Yahoo Finance is currently paying for redistribution. And thus, users get only what data is supported through the website.\\n\\nOn the other hand, OpenBB SDK allows you to retrieve data from over 50 different APIs (and growing). With yfinance being one of these APIs.\\n\\nSince OpenBB SDK requires API keys from most of the data sources, these have incentives to partner with OpenBB. Because:\\n\\n1. Marketing opportunity due to significant larger pool of users\\n2. New revenue stream\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nIn essence, Yfinance API:\\n\\n- Not officially supported by Yahoo Finance\\n- No incentive for Yahoo Finance\\n- Limited data by what Yahoo Finance displays\\n- May become obsolete\\n\\nOn the other hand, OpenBB SDK:\\n\\n- Marketing for new data sources\\n- New revenue stream for partners through premium API keys\\n- (Almost) unlimited data - open source project that keeps on adding new data sources\\n- Multiple data sources for same data (user has choices)\\n\\nAs counter-intuitive as it sounds:\\n\\nThe shutting down of yfinance API (which is one of the data sources that OpenBB SDK has access to) would be beneficial to OpenBB adoption. This is because users would need to migrate to OpenBB SDK as that\u2019s the most mature and maintained open source financial API.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to drop me a message!"},{"id":"how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2022-08-14-how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-14-how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb.md","title":"How I became CEO of OpenBB","description":"This post talks about my story of becoming the CEO of OpenBB, the company behind the fastest growing open source project in finance.","date":"2022-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"openbb","permalink":"/blog/tags/openbb"},{"inline":true,"label":"ceo","permalink":"/blog/tags/ceo"},{"inline":true,"label":"founder-story","permalink":"/blog/tags/founder-story"},{"inline":true,"label":"origin-story","permalink":"/blog/tags/origin-story"},{"inline":true,"label":"startup","permalink":"/blog/tags/startup"},{"inline":true,"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"inline":true,"label":"career-path","permalink":"/blog/tags/career-path"},{"inline":true,"label":"entrepreneurship","permalink":"/blog/tags/entrepreneurship"},{"inline":true,"label":"side-project","permalink":"/blog/tags/side-project"}],"readingTime":4.07,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb","title":"How I became CEO of OpenBB","date":"2022-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2022-08-14-how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb.png","tags":["openbb","ceo","founder-story","origin-story","startup","open-source","career-path","entrepreneurship","side-project"],"description":"This post talks about my story of becoming the CEO of OpenBB, the company behind the fastest growing open source project in finance."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why you should drop yfinance API and adopt OpenBB SDK","permalink":"/blog/why-you-should-drop-yfinance-api-and-adopt-openbb-sdk"},"nextItem":{"title":"Web3, symbols and community","permalink":"/blog/web3-symbols-and-community"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2022-08-14-how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis post talks about my story of becoming the CEO of OpenBB, the company behind the fastest growing open source project in\xa0finance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nBoth my parents are Portuguese and emigrated to Switzerland for better conditions. This is where my brother and I were born. We moved back to our small hometown in Portugal when I was 8 years old.\\n\\nWhen I was 21 years old I moved to London to pursue my MSc in control systems at the Imperial College. I also joined a semiconductor company as a Software Design Engineer.\\n\\n![ezgif com-optimize (5)](/blog/2022-08-14-how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb_1.png)\\n\\nIn my spare time I learned Python so I could become more proficient in machine learning and artificial intelligence. When my mathematics professor learned of my interest in Python he challenged me to write the [code behind his PhD thesis](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/UnivariateTimeSeriesForecast) on \\"_Data Science in the Modeling and Forecasting of Financial Time Series: from Classic methodologies to Deep Learning_\\" which combined open source, ML/AI and finance. This was when I first started to realize my passion for financial data.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-08-14-how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb_2.png)\\n\\nI was inspired by books like \\"_Rich dad Poor dad_\\" which allowed me to understand that the only way to build true generational wealth is through investing. Now that I started to accumulate more savings through my professional pursuits, and with my finance interest increasing from my thesis work, I wanted to invest my own capital.\\n\\nWhat I learned was that investing was a highly cumbersome process. Unlike coding where the tooling (e.g. VSCode) is optimized for efficiency and allows us to automate a lot of processes, investing was highly inefficient and impossible to automate.\\n\\nI was spending hours doing my own investment research (multiple tabs open researching several different sources on a ticker, screenshot the data to put on a document or share with friends, write my thoughts, and repeat), and this had to be done for every single ticker at different instances of time otherwise the data would become irrelevant.\\n\\nI learned from Reddit users how they gained insights and performed due diligence. I quickly realized their \\"workflow\\" was just as inefficient as mine. I concluded that the only aspect of research that should require user input is the interpretation. As far as I was concerned, all data gathering should be automated.\\n\\nI began investigating potential investment research tools that allowed automation and couldn\'t find any, not even the mythical $24k/year Bloomberg terminal. I looked for platforms on GitHub where I could build on top of with no success.\\n\\nDuring Covid Christmas break, the flight to visit my parents was cancelled, so I ended up staying at home and sketching/building what would become my own investment research platform. I noticed that there were hundreds of data providers offering free data tiers where the data provided didn\'t correlate with each other. If I wanted access to paid datasets or more requests per minute it would be as simple as to upgrade my API key to a paid plan.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-08-14-how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb_3.png)\\n\\nOver the next two months I built a python based command line interface in my spare time for and released the first lines of code as Open Source under the name \\"Gamestonk Terminal\\" since I was an investor in Gamestop and Elon Musk had recently tweeted his now infamous [\\"Gamestonk\\" tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703?s=20).\\n\\nThe project went viral in a couple of minutes on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/m515yk/gamestonk_terminal_the_equivalent_to_an/) and [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26258773). In under 24h we had over 4,000 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal), and hundreds of messages requesting features, thanking me for the tool, or reporting bugs.\\n\\nThe number of issues and feature requests was overwhelming for a single person working part-time, so I created a [Discord group](https://openbb.co/discord) and started building a community of users. Many of those same first users went on to become core maintainers of the project. The community started adding new data sources, new features and even new asset classes to the project\u200a-\u200asoon after we were supporting crypto, ETFs, options, forex, and macro economy.\\n\\nMy goal was never to build a business/company with this product. My motivation was to create a better investment research platform that was unavailable until then. When we got approached by JJ (from OSS Capital), it was a no-brainer to create OpenBB, as this would allow me to accelerate the product vision and build the world\'s leading investment research platform."},{"id":"web3-symbols-and-community","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/web3-symbols-and-community","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community.md","title":"Web3, symbols and community","description":"This blog post discusses the importance of strong communities in the Web 3.0 space, the role of decentralization, and how voting frameworks based on smart contracts can empower users.","date":"2022-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"web3","permalink":"/blog/tags/web-3"},{"inline":true,"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"inline":true,"label":"decentralization","permalink":"/blog/tags/decentralization"},{"inline":true,"label":"blockchain","permalink":"/blog/tags/blockchain"},{"inline":true,"label":"smart-contracts","permalink":"/blog/tags/smart-contracts"}],"readingTime":5.72,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"web3-symbols-and-community","title":"Web3, symbols and community","date":"2022-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community.png","tags":["web3","community","decentralization","blockchain","smart-contracts"],"description":"This blog post discusses the importance of strong communities in the Web 3.0 space, the role of decentralization, and how voting frameworks based on smart contracts can empower users."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How I became CEO of OpenBB","permalink":"/blog/how-i-became-ceo-of-openbb"},"nextItem":{"title":"Remote + Flexible work >> Salary","permalink":"/blog/remote-flexible-work-salary"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis blog post discusses the importance of strong communities in the Web 3.0 space, the role of decentralization, and how voting frameworks based on smart contracts can empower users.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nIf you have been paying attention to the Web 3.0 space, you should have realized that most of the projects in the space rely on strong communities.\\n\\n### Why on Web 3.0?\\n\\nOn a centralized concept (Web 2), there is usually a regulatory entity that decides whether something is True or False on a project/product. This means that there\u2019s a single centralized company responsible for making a decision and users must trust that this entity is acting on their best interests.\\n\\nFurthermore, the users do not stand to win anything whether the decision is True or False. They may identify more with one of the outcomes, but there is no personal incentive to the user. Even if a user can relate with the outcomes they never feel a sense of belonging, as deep down they are aware that their opinion is not being taken into account.\\n\\nOn a decentralized concept (Web 3), the story is the very different. A decentralized community is responsible for deciding the True or False, based on a voting framework defined a-priori. This means that the group of users, based on smart contracts executed on the blockchain, can vote on a particular decision. **This is where the importance of a strong community kicks in.**\\n\\nOn Web 2 the users must trust that such entity is acting on user\u2019s best interests. That trust, on Web 3, occurs in form of a strong community. The best way for a user to trust the decisions of a group of people is to know that a group shares the same values and has incentives towards the success of the same project/product.\\n\\n**In fact, I believe that in general when these votes occur, the more unanimous the decisions are, the stronger the community is.**\\n\\n> **NOTE:** Although Web 3 communities are stronger than Web 2 ones, I believe that when something goes wrong the Web 3 communities break faster as they don\u2019t have a common enemy due to the decentralized concept (e.g. LUNA debacle). On the other hand, Web 2 communities can \u201chold\u201d onto the fact that their common enemy is now the entity that they trusted to act on their best interests (e.g. Robinhood vs wallstreetbets).\\n\\n### Why build strong communities?\\n\\n_The Web 3.0 concept doesn\u2019t only benefit from strong communities but is built on top of it._ For worldwide adoption in products/projects/companies the space need strong communities.\\n\\nWhy does money have value? Because people believe that they will be able to exchange it for goods/services in the future. Why do people believe that? Because they trust the entity that is managing such currency.\\n\\nAnalogously, for a digital asset to have value, people need to believe that they will be able to exchange it for goods/services in the future. Since there is no entity to trust, people need to believe that the community will believe that a certain digital asset has value. This belief exists because there are incentives (usually financial or status) for its members.\\n\\nOnce this happens we enter into the law of supply and demand where the value of digital asset goes up as there is either less supply or more demand.\\n\\nThese communities can easily be found on CT or Discord/Telegram servers.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community_1.png)\\n\\n### How are strong communities created?\\n\\nIf we learn from history, we see that the most loyal and bigger communities **always recurred at symbology** to achieve such, some examples: sports clubs, religion, countries, clans, societies, \u2026\\n\\nThe truth is that we humans constantly seek this sense of belonging (or are afraid of being alone). When we see multiple people on social media utilizing the same symbols to represent their beliefs, we want to be part of that group, of that community.\\n\\nThis can be seen over and over again on Web3, particularly in CT:\\n\\n- Changing the eyes\u2019 color of your twitter\u2019s pfp which represents being bullish on crypto (usually red for BTC and blue for ETH)\\n- Emojis after the username\\n- Utilizing the NFT you acquired from a collection that you believe in\\n- Adding a \u201c.eth\u201d at the end of the username\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community_2.png)\\n\\n### Why does this matter?\\n\\nCompanies outside of the Web 3.0 space will start picking up on this to build stronger communities and have a stronger identity (e.g. Notion and their employees pfp on social media). This is even more relevant for open source companies (Web 2.5 if you will), which rely on their communities to build a successful company (e.g. Hugging Face \ud83e\udd17 ).\\n\\n> _I believe that companies will start thinking about the emojis that their community can use while coming up with the name of the brand and logo._\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nAs for OpenBB, we are a fintech open source company that focuses on providing better investment research for everyone, anywhere. The finance sector we are in is composed of multiple players that have been on the top of the industry for decades. We come in with a radical different approach, bottom-up.\\n\\n> _Being open source for us is not a choice but a need if we are to disrupt traditional investment research platforms with years of head start._\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nOnce we knew that we wanted the logo to be extracted from the \u201cBB\u201d, it was immediate that the butterfly emoji (\ud83e\udd8b) would be used. Furthermore, a butterfly is a metaphor for transformation, which in our context, represents OpenBB Terminal allowing each investor to evolve and finally fly (i.e. achieve financial freedom).\\n\\nIn order for our users to start relating to the butterfly emoji (\ud83e\udd8b) with our brand we have several cues:\\n\\n- On the landing page\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community_3.png)\\n\\n- Official social media channels\\n- Our team members use it in their socials\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community_4.png)\\n\\n- On the OpenBB Terminal as the default flair,\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community_5.png)\\n\\nAnd even to replace the asterisk (*) when inserting the password to enter our OpenBB Bot platform, **because details matter.**\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-06-28-web3-symbols-and-community_6.png)\\n\\nAnd that is what we are doing at OpenBB to build a stronger community?

At least by choice \ud83d\ude43\\n\\nI mean, who would tell Morty and Sum Sum that I wouldn\u2019t be at home to play?\\n\\n**I\u2019m a strong believer that work should wrap around your lifestyle and not vice-versa.**\\n\\nOn average, a person works 40 hours a week and sleeps 8 hours a day. This means that out of 168h per week you have 72h for personal time. In terms of percentage we have: 24% for work, 33% for sleep, and 43% for personal time.\\n\\nSo how come most people have almost 2x as much personal time compared to work time and they still feel like they are in this 9\u20135 rat race and their life revolves around work?\\n\\nWell, here\u2019s the 4 scenarios as I see it\u2026\\n\\n**1. The work is not remote (and not flexible).**\\n\\n  - If we account for the commute and stress associated with, personal time gets directly transferred into work time.\\n  - E.g. with a daily 2 hour commute Mon-Fri, which is very typical, this means that your personal time is divided into 30% for work and 37% for personal. This isn\u2019t event including the part where you have to prepare to leave the house, and the tiredness resultant from the commute.\\n\\n**2. The work is remote but not flexible.**\\n\\n  - This is much better than the previous. But it\u2019s still not good enough. The argument here is not due to absolute time but performance and state of mind.\\n  - Life is not straightforward. We, as individuals, are very different between ourselves. Our bodies, mind, brain, relationships, \u2026 work very differently. By not being flexible on the working hours you are basically ignoring all of that diversity and grouping everyone into a single 9\u20135 + Mon-Fri category.\\n  - _The \u201cironic\u201d part is that most companies promote diversity and don\u2019t think about this. Which just shows that the diversity topic has become very much a marketing vehicle._\\n  - In my case, I\u2019m a night owl, I don\u2019t usually wake up too early, because I am much more productive when I stay awake until 3/4 am. If I have to wake up early because someone decided that 8:30am was the time that everyone needed to \u201ccheck in\u201d you are basically not getting the most out of me.\\n  - One may wonder, well, this is a company problem because they are paying for an employee that is not performing as much as they could. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not true, it\u2019s a much bigger problem to the employee. This is because when an employee excels at a job they tend to have a much happier life which in turn increases performance, which increases happiness, and so on and so forth.\\n\\n**3. There is no mention for not remote but flexible because, in my opinion, that makes very little sense.**\\n\\n**4. Now, let\u2019s imagine the scenario where the work is remote and flexible.**\\n\\n  - This is where it gets interesting. When we fall on this scenario your job perspective changes drastically. This is because at this point you put yourself first and can define your own priorities while having a pool of time to get a job done at your own time.\\n  - E.g. you can plan activities with friends, do exercise, meditate, \u2026 whatever suits your lifestyle. Which will give you a boost of energy to perform even better at your job. On top of this, you don\u2019t need to squash the work within Mon-Fri, once you are in this flexible regime you may use the weekend to your advantage. Flights at 20 Euros on Tuesday to come back Thursday? Fine, I\u2019ll work during weekend to make up for this time\\n  - There are people that love a 9\u20135 Mon-Fri schedule and that is fine. For those it means that the 9\u20135 Mon-Fri system implemented got it right. In fact, I would argue, that they are still wrapping work around lifestyle, it\u2019s just that their lifestyle is working 9\u20135 Mon-Fri and enjoying time outside these hours.\\n\\nThe downsides of this fully flexible work are:\\n\\n- Interaction with coworkers and communication. But with us going global due to remote work, it doesn\u2019t really matter, since the 9\u20135 hours of different countries would already lead to this problem\\n- Tracking employee timesheet. I think that a company shouldn\u2019t track an employee timesheet because results are far more important than working hours, and can be just as measurable.\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nAll of this to say that at OpenBB we have:\\n\\n- **REMOTE WORK:** As long as you are in a location with internet access, we are not worried.

This blog post discusses the thought process behind this unique marketing strategy.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nWhen [OpenBB Terminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) started last year, I went from having your typical career as a Software Engineer to becoming a co-founder & CEO of a C-Corporation overnight. One thing that I\'ve really learnt from this change, is I can no longer code for 12\u201316 hours a day straight as my role now involves so much more than this\u2026 and most interestingly, one of those things is marketing.\\n\\nDuring Easter in Lisbon, I was thinking about how to increase the visability of [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/). _An investment research platform for everyone, anywhere_. Seems self-explanatory and something most of us would relate to, but the problem is reaching a bigger audience.\\n\\nDue to [our $8.5M funding](https://openbb.co/blog/gme-didnt-take-me-to-the-moon-but-gamestonk-terminal-did) we have money in the bank, which means we can afford to do some ads campaigns. However, I very much dislike the traditional type of ads, whether that is with Google, Instagram, Twitter or YouTube. Particularly YouTube ones, when I see an ad there I immediately think less of the product being advertised due to how intrusive these are.\\n\\nThat\'s why I started thinking of ways to share our OpenBB brand in a non-intrusive way. In fact, I went one step further and started thinking when I personally would welcome ads.\\n\\nFunnily enough, the first thing that came to my mind was when I go to the bathroom without my phone. Although there\'s no ads on the back of shampoos/shower gel/soap/spray, I would very much welcome them.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-04-21-looking-for-a-new-tattoo-openbb-has-you-covered-literally_1.png)\\n\\nIt\'s not like knowing the %s of ingredients that makes up cleaning products has a lot of use cases\u2026\\n\\nThis brought me to the conclusion that I would only welcome ads if I was bored and didn\'t have anything keeping me \\"too busy\\". This immediately made me think of London underground ads (the most effective type of DOOH imho). I always read those ads. The main reason being that I don\'t have WiFi underground and the noise is too loud to listen to a podcast. Hence, I imagined the underground looking like:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-04-21-looking-for-a-new-tattoo-openbb-has-you-covered-literally_2.png)\\n\\nWhen I checked for the prices, I was looking at a marketing campaign for a couple of days in a couple of stations costing over 5 digits, which is quite expensive for the short time-span.\\n\\nTherefore, I started to think of cheaper alternatives that yielded a better ROI. The next thing that passed through my mind was wearing OpenBB swag (yet to be revealed, [subscribe to our newsletter](https://openbb.co/newsletter) to know more). However, I feel like nowadays everyone has a t-shirt with a different logo and these aren\'t as noticeable as before \u2014 at least that\'s my perspective.\\n\\nThis lead me to think: **What about a tattoo?** It\'s a similar concept than OpenBB clothes but more powerful. In addition, when wearing OpenBB clothes with a visible tattoo, this will create a \\"curiosity\\" effect since the symbol is repeated (clothes and tattoo). In addition, I\'ve not come across anyone using their body to express their brand.\\n\\nLater that day I booked a tattoo slot, paid 100 euros, and got the OpenBB logo on the back of my arm as shown below,\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-04-21-looking-for-a-new-tattoo-openbb-has-you-covered-literally_3.png)\\n\\nI will let you know on my socials how many people ask about this tattoo over the course of my life.\\n\\nAnd if you like [our logo](https://www.openbb.design/9242dc28c/p/809a44-logo) and [our values](https://www.openbb.design/9242dc28c/p/91bbcc-our-values), OpenBB will pay you for the tattoo.\\n\\n**One things for sure, now I can definitely put the gym membership as a company expense since I\'m a walking billboard \ud83d\ude04**\\n\\nThe first walking/running/coding/eating/drinking OpenBB billboard."},{"id":"how-i-created-the-best-discord-meme-bot","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/how-i-created-the-best-discord-meme-bot","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2022-04-09-how-i-created-the-best-discord-meme-bot.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-09-how-i-created-the-best-discord-meme-bot.md","title":"How I created the best discord meme bot","description":"In this blog post, I share my journey of creating a Discord meme bot, the role it played in building a vibrant community around our open source project, and how you can add your own memes to the bot.","date":"2022-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"discord","permalink":"/blog/tags/discord"},{"inline":true,"label":"meme-bot","permalink":"/blog/tags/meme-bot"},{"inline":true,"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"inline":true,"label":"community-building","permalink":"/blog/tags/community-building"}],"readingTime":4.32,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-i-created-the-best-discord-meme-bot","title":"How I created the best discord meme bot","date":"2022-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2022-04-09-how-i-created-the-best-discord-meme-bot.png","tags":["discord","meme-bot","open-source","community-building"],"description":"In this blog post, I share my journey of creating a Discord meme bot, the role it played in building a vibrant community around our open source project, and how you can add your own memes to the bot."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Looking for a new tattoo?

Once I made the project open source and contributors started to appear, I slowly saw my time shifting **from building a product to building a community**. This community ultimately would end up building the product, but from my end, I need to be able to pass on my passion to the project and vision.\\n\\nDeveloping features for the terminal only took me a couple of minutes, whereas the connection with the community is a long-time game. You don\u2019t become close with someone you\u2019ve never met within couple of minutes. Instead you need to put effort into the relationship and **consistency is key**.\\n\\nThe community on our Discord was growing day by day. And so was my relationship with the people in it. The truth is, we were not only sharing insights about the platform, but were laughing and bonding together whilst building it. **And memes/gifs are a big part of these interactions.**\\n\\nFor people who know me, they know how much I love memes and how I can always create memes for every situation (honestly, all the time I spent on Instagram is finally paying off).\\n\\nAlthough I believe that we have one of the most exciting open source projects going on, I also strongly believe that our fun culture (i.e. memes) is what makes contributors want to work in this particualr environment. **Building the future of investment research can be fun and this is what we\u2019re proving.**\\n\\nAt this stage, I think I\u2019ve spent more time interacting with people than I have working on the platform. The funny thing is that **the platform is 10x better than what it would be if I was working on my own**. Creating a strong community pays off and this is why since the start I was having calls with literally everyone to help them install our platform. Today, most of the team at OpenBB was met on Discord whilst working on the platform. **I didn\u2019t need any interviews, they weren\u2019t candidates anymore but people that I enjoyed to work with** and wanted on the team.\\n\\nSorry for the background story, but it was important to me to explain why I worked on this. **The interesting part of the article starts now.**\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n**The idea of Discord Memes is to avoid to open [imgflip](https://imgflip.com/) everytime I wanted to add text to a meme.** Personally, I love the gifs available through Discord but I think a meme with text is much more powerful (and funny).\\n\\nWhen I started coding this here and there, I wanted the code to be super straightforward so it was very simple and fast to add a new meme to the pool. And so I did.\\n\\nThe process to add new memes is incredibly easy. Go to the [project](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/discord-memes) and star it for starters (also [OpenBB Terminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) since you\u2019re at it). Then,\\n\\n1. Add the meme you want to the `memes/` folder, e.g. `spongebob.jpg`\\n\\n2. Then create a function with the same name of the image (e.g. `spongebob`) with the following format\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n```python\\n@create_and_send_meme()\\ndef spongebob(inter, text: str = None, _=None):\\n    if text:\\n        _.text(\\n            0.5,\\n            0.2,\\n            \\"\\\\n\\".join(wrap(\'\'.join(choice((str.upper, str.lower))(c) for c in text), 40)),\\n            fontsize=20,\\n            color=\\"white\\",\\n            alpha=0.9,\\n            horizontalalignment=\\"center\\",\\n            path_effects=[pe.withStroke(linewidth=4, foreground=\\"black\\")]\\n        )\\n    return _\\n```\\n\\n3. That\u2019s it.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n**Note:** I created a python decorator `@create_and_send_meme()` that basically abstracts all the memes created and picks up the image on memes with the same name of the function. This way, the person adding a meme just needs to focus on the text on the image, i.e. it\'s location, size, where it wraps, colours and alignment.\\n\\nI used a playground.ipynb notebook, which is also on the repo, to increase the speed of the text placement on each of the memes I added.\\n\\nThis is how it looks,\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-04-09-how-i-created-the-best-discord-meme-bot_1.png)\\n\\nOR\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-04-09-how-i-created-the-best-discord-meme-bot_2.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, our Discord server just stepped up. [Join us](https://openbb.co/discord) to try out the meme bot, build the future of investment research or just to say hi.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll be waiting for you. \ud83e\udd8b"},{"id":"meet-the-most-advanced-investment-research-platform","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/meet-the-most-advanced-investment-research-platform","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2022-03-21-meet-the-most-advanced-investment-research-platform.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-21-meet-the-most-advanced-investment-research-platform.md","title":"Meet the most advanced investment research platform","description":"Meet the most advanced investment research platform.

The main outcomes of these meeting were:\\n\\n1. Relative and Absolute menu jumping, e.g. if i\u2019m in crypto/ta and want to go to stocks/ta I can do:\\n\\n   a. Absolute: `/stocks/load tsla/ta`\\n\\n   b. Relative: `../../stocks/load tsla/ta`\\n\\n3. Scripting feature. You can now interact with the terminal through a sequence of commands, e.g.: `stocks/disc/ugs -l 3/gtech/active`.\\n\\n4. `reset` command everywhere to allow for faster development as it exits from the terminal and comes to the same menu running new terminal code and its API keys.\\n\\n5. Auto-completion in commands with choices.\\n\\n6. When misspelling a command name, if it\u2019s similar enough that the terminal recognises the right command, it will replace it, to speed up interaction.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-01-06-gamestonk-terminal-ux-features_1.png)\\n\\n6. Running a `.gst` job, like `python terminal.py scripts/test_stocks_disc.gst` which allows to run a sequence of commands of the terminal. In the future we can take advantage of this for integration tests. The user can build their own daily routines to speed up the investment process.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-01-06-gamestonk-terminal-ux-features_2.png)\\n\\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking. This is a massive improvement over the terminal usage up until now, and that\u2019s a **LOT** of code changes. Which is very much true, to be specific, this engineering effort resulted in:\\n\\n> **370 files changed with 44,875 additions and 18,463 deletions**\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nAnd you may be wondering how long did this take us to do. Nope, it wasn\u2019t months but\u2026\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-01-06-gamestonk-terminal-ux-features_3.png)\\n\\n**1 week. Yup, a single f*king week.** You can see that it was finalised with these PRs ([#1049](https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal/pull/1049), [#1041](https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal/pull/1041), [#1048](https://medium.com/@dro-lopes/gamestonk-terminal-ux-features-f9754b484919#1048)).\\n\\nIn that week we split work, did pair programming, we called each other to discuss better implementation practices, we changed the architecture 2/3 more times\u2026 On top of that, I was feeling overwhelmed with the stocks menu, I clearly underestimated how many features we have (how naive\u2026), so the 3 other maintainers jumped on it and helped me out. In 3 or so years of software engineering, this was** teamwork like I\u2019ve not felt before**.\\n\\nThat weekend I was so happy as we accomplished this task that I think I didn\u2019t even work on the terminal that Sunday! Doesn\u2019t happen often these days!\\n\\nHowever, as a good friend of mine told me:\\n\\n> _**\u201cThe entertainment industry hasn\u2019t found yet something more appealing than developing code towards a product I believe in and with people I like\u201d**_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nI still think about this often, and this is what I tell my girlfriend, to explain why I\u2019m coding and not playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with her. (the fact she always beats me at it also may be considered as a factor \ud83e\udd23).\\n\\nYou may be thinking this is a one off, the reality is that **it isn\u2019t**. Another example can be seen in [this blog post](https://dev.to/northern64bit/aspiring-16-year-old-quant-developer-contributing-to-open-source-application-16k4). This goes over the story of the development of our discord bot where it all started from a message from a **16yo contributor that wants to become a quant**. He wanted to not only improve his python skills with us but also bring the terminal features to a bigger audience. Working with us in an open-source project is helping him towards achieving his life-goal dream.\\n\\nWhile I write this post another contributor, finishing his CPA, is working on [improving the code resulting from that UX effort by creating a base class](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/pull/1141) so that new developers can add controllers much easily (he estimates a reduction of 11% of codebase size based on \u201cnapkin maths\u201d as he puts it).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2022-01-06-gamestonk-terminal-ux-features_4.png)\\n\\nWhile user experience is critical, so is user interface.

However, at the time I was too busy to work on the concept so I asked Jeroen if he could sketch something up on a jupyter notebook.\\n\\nWithin the following week, Jeroen sent a Jupyter notebook explaining the FinanceDatabase module and what we could have in a Sector and Industry analysis.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-12-02-sector-and-industry-analysis-gamestonk-terminal_2.png)\\n\\nIn addition, he also mentioned his [PassiveInvestor package](https://github.com/JerBouma/ThePassiveInvestor), and ended up [implementing it on his own in Gamestonk Terminal](https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal/pull/857)! This was a great addition, as it strengthened our **ETF context** and provided a slick Excel report for the Excel fans out there! See his [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6859887432532291584/) on the experience.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-12-02-sector-and-industry-analysis-gamestonk-terminal_3.png)\\n\\n...\\n\\nForward to last weekend (1.5 months later), I had a free Sunday afternoon so started working on the development of this menu. I started by thinking about what would make this menu more flexible and powerful.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-12-02-sector-and-industry-analysis-gamestonk-terminal_4.png)\\n\\nThese were my thoughts about what it needs:\\n\\n- **Several filtering parameters** as the number of companies in the database is pretty huge with 155.705 tickers, 16 sectors, 242 industries, 111 countries and 82 exchanges. These were the filters selected: Country, Sector, Industry, Market Cap and Flag to include/exclude international exchanges.\\n- **To be able to do some statistics on the sector**, industries and countries (e.g. companies per sector/industry with a specified country and market cap) which allows users to better understand companies landscape of a sector and industry.\\n- **To get the financials of the companies that fall under that filter subset** (e.g. return on assets, quick ratio, debt to equity), and then compare these in order to get the best performers.\\n- Since one of the previous financials isn\u2019t enough to understand which company would be best to invest in, I wanted the filtered companies to have the capability to jump onto the comparison analysis menu so you could get all the capabilities of comparing historical price data, volume data, income/balance/cash flow, sentiment, or even technical indicators.\\n- If in the stocks context I had Tesla loaded, I wanted to go into this sia menu and get all the filtering parameters to be ready to filter for companies similar to Tesla in terms of (Sector, Industry, Country and Market Cap).\\n\\nBy Sunday night, I created the [pull request for this](https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal/pull/995). Due to the due diligent reviews performed by the main contributors of the project, the menu got a lot of improvements. Some of them were:\\n- Do not display companies that account for under a certain threshold (1%) and therefore sum them in an \u201cOthers\u201d slice.\\n- Allow to export all the data as a table.\\n- After filtering and getting financials, save the data for faster data retrieval if the same filters are used.\\n- Minor bug fixes.\\n\\nAfter a lot of comments and feedback from the main maintainers, and everyone being happy with this first iteration, the PR got merged. In fact, one of the main maintainers found a hidden gem while testing it.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-12-02-sector-and-industry-analysis-gamestonk-terminal_5.png)\\n\\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ve been in contact with Jeroen about adding some more capabilities to his FinanceDatabase package so that everyone could benefit from them. Some examples are:\\n- When an industry is selected, the corresponding sector should be automatically filled.\\n- If I select a country and a market cap for filtering, my sector choices should be bounded by what exists within those.\\n- I should be able to query about companies landscape in terms of a country. E.g. I want to understand what countries have the most large cap companies within the Financial Services sector.\\n\\nThis would not only make the FinanceDatabase a more powerful Package, which would in turn benefit Gamestonk Terminal sia menu, and ultimately our thousands of users!\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-12-02-sector-and-industry-analysis-gamestonk-terminal_6.png)\\n\\nThis is an example of how the Sector and Industry Analysis menu looks (as a bonus I show how you can go into the Comparison Analysis menu):\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-12-02-sector-and-industry-analysis-gamestonk-terminal_7.png)\\n\\nNext time you know, it all starts with an e-mail. At Gamestonk Terminal we are on a role to have the best investment research terminal, and hope this story reflects it.\\n\\nTry it now, it\u2019s free. \u2764\ufe0f"},{"id":"handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2021-11-17-handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-17-handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member.md","title":"Handing your twitter account to your most avid community member","description":"Handing over the Twitter account of Gamestonk Terminal to an active community member and the impact it had on the project\'s growth and engagement.","date":"2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"community-building","permalink":"/blog/tags/community-building"},{"inline":true,"label":"twitter","permalink":"/blog/tags/twitter"},{"inline":true,"label":"open-source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"inline":true,"label":"gamestonk-terminal","permalink":"/blog/tags/gamestonk-terminal"}],"readingTime":4.97,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member","title":"Handing your twitter account to your most avid community member","date":"2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2021-11-17-handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member.png","tags":["community-building","twitter","open-source","gamestonk-terminal"],"description":"Handing over the Twitter account of Gamestonk Terminal to an active community member and the impact it had on the project\'s growth and engagement."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Sector and Industry Analysis \u2014 Gamestonk Terminal","permalink":"/blog/sector-and-industry-analysis-gamestonk-terminal"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Start of my Machine Learning journey","permalink":"/blog/the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2021-11-17-handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nHanding over the Twitter account of Gamestonk Terminal to an active community member and the impact it had on the project\'s growth and engagement.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nWhen I started [Gamestonk Terminal](https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal) I had no idea of the reach and impact it would have. From getting **over 3.5k stars on GitHub on the first single day alone**, to trending [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/lrndzi/cant_afford_the_bloomberg_terminal_no_worries_i/) and receiving overwhelming feedback, to receiving a message from an ex-colleague based in Switzerland about my name being [top 1 on Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26258773). As if this wasn\u2019t enough, a couple of days later the project got featured by [VICE Magazine](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjp9vp/gamestonk-terminal-is-a-diy-meme-stock-version-of-bloomberg-terminal) and [Daily Fintech](https://dailyfintech.com/2021/02/25/never-underestimate-bloomberg-but-here-are-5-reasons-why-the-gamestonk-terminal-is-a-contender/).\\n\\nAs a result, my social life was impacted and had little time to even cuddle my puppy, due to the amount of feature requests, issues\u2026 the usual somehow ungrateful life of an open-source maintainer\u2026 I\u2019m not complaining though, as I live for this.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-11-17-handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member_1.png)\\n\\nMoving forward a couple of weeks, it became clear to myself that I was building a strong community around what can/will/should be a leading product in the emerging fintech industry and Internet 3.0. Therefore, I knew that github issues and discussions wouldn\u2019t be enough to interact with all members of the community, so Discord turned out to be the best option going forward (let\u2019s be honest: mostly because of the convenience that Discord offers to share memes, feel free to check my creations on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/2KnVnkDTxM), you can thank me later).\\n\\nMy next rookie mistake was thinking I could use Discord announcements and @ everyone, as a means for updating the community on new features. Being the #1 investment research free and open-source project on github gets you several PRs a day being merged, so in all the fairness the announcements were recurrent with constant several new features. You can check my [one hour live programming stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BMI9cleTTg) of adding a feature to the terminal.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-11-17-handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member_2.png)\\n\\nThis is when I realized that Discord wasn\u2019t the best place for this type of communication. I needed a platform where I could share these features ad-hoc and that only alerted users who wanted to be up-to-date with our latest features. And this is when I created our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/gamestonkt), @gamestonkt.\\n\\nReviewing the history of our Twitter feed, you can see that this is exclusively what our handle was used for. It just shared new features every day. It felt like I was always playing catchup to the growing number of features piling up in the queue waiting to be announced on Twitter. With the project already having **over 500 features** in less 1 year, this inevitable outcome would be a surprise to no one. (**yup, I repeat, over 500**).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-11-17-handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member_3.png)\\n\\nHowever, I felt like **it missed personality**... With time being a limiting factor \u2014 time was more efficiently used improving the terminal \u2014 the public facing demonstrations were a lower priority. When you believe this much in a product, the product ends up speaking for itself.\\n\\n> _\u201cIf you build it, they will come\u201d \u2014 Field of Dreams_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nIt then occurred to me, why am I handling our Twitter? Why not leave this up to one of our most avid and vocal users that has been with project since beginning?\\n\\nAs Jim from \u201cThe Office\u201d would do, let\u2019s do a PROS & CONS table.\\n\\n### Pros\\n\\n- The user represents the community that the twitter content is targeted at.\\n- The user is an active daily user and will help to demonstrate features in the terminal.\\n- The user is keen on learning the ins and outs of the product.\\n- This user is not only a user anymore but a friend given his interaction with the maintainers.\\n- Lastly, I get to spend time doing what I enjoy: coding and meme content on our Discord.\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n- The user finds out my mother\u2019s maiden name and the name of my first pet.\\n\\nThis is really a no brainer the more you think about it. I think it depends a lot on the type of people you have in your community and how confident you are on this individual .\\n\\nWe were lucky, because we had the **perfect fit**: an active Discord user **@Danglewood**, who had built an engaged audience, generating over 130K+ in Reddit karma over Q2 2021. It was clear that **@Danglewood** was having an impact on driving traffic and user engagement by posting data and his personal research with screenshots of Gamestonk Terminal.\\n\\nIn the future, **our report feature will allow easy sharing of this information**, I already can\u2019t wait for this. Through a combination of humour and truths, he was engaging the audience\u2019s curiosity by providing them with ways to filter out the ever-present noise within stock market information.\\n\\nIt made sense to bring this approach to [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/gamestonkt) feed which has since transformed and now offers insights, educational nuggets, and data as well as presenting new features. The end result speaks for itself!\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-11-17-handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member_4.png)\\n\\nOn your end, what is your opinion? And why do you 100% agree that this was the best decision?"},{"id":"the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2021-11-07-the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-07-the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey.md","title":"The Start of my Machine Learning journey","description":"The start of my journey into the world of Machine Learning, from learning Python to understanding the underlying mathematics of ML algorithms.","date":"2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"machine-learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/machine-learning"},{"inline":true,"label":"python","permalink":"/blog/tags/python"},{"inline":true,"label":"data-science","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-science"},{"inline":true,"label":"education","permalink":"/blog/tags/education"},{"inline":true,"label":"self-learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-learning"}],"readingTime":4.92,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey","title":"The Start of my Machine Learning journey","date":"2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","image":"/blog/2021-11-07-the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey.png","tags":["machine-learning","python","data-science","education","self-learning"],"description":"The start of my journey into the world of Machine Learning, from learning Python to understanding the underlying mathematics of ML algorithms."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Handing your twitter account to your most avid community member","permalink":"/blog/handing-your-twitter-account-to-your-most-avid-community-member"},"nextItem":{"title":"An unusual journey learning about NNs for a PhD thesis","permalink":"/blog/an-unusual-journey-learning-about-nns-for-a-phd-thesis"}},"content":"<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img width=\\"600\\" src=\\"/blog/2021-11-07-the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey.png\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThe start of my journey into the world of Machine Learning, from learning Python to understanding the underlying mathematics of ML algorithms.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nDuring my studies at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) - 3ish years ago - I was introduced to the topic of Machine Learning, an area that I had always been interested about.\\n\\nAt that time, not only I didn\'t know python, as `from sklearn.decomposition import PCA` wasn\u2019t allowed. Therefore, we had to write the PCA (and other) algorithms in Matlab from scratch, which was great because it exposed us to the maths behind each algorithm.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-11-07-the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey_1.png)\\n\\nThe gif above is from my graduation at Royal Albert Hall with a MSc. in Control Systems with Distinction.\\n\\nAfter concluding my thesis (and paper): \\"[Energy savings from an Ecological Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: a Battery Electric Vehicle platoon investigation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8796226)\\", which was presented at the 2019 European Control Conference in Napoli, I had finally time to focus on Machine Learning topics during my spare time through late hours and into weekends.\\n\\nI started by doing the famous MOOC **\u201cMachine Learning - Andrew Ng\u201d**. Saying that the course was good is an understatement. I ended up spending a long time on the course as I was taking notes and revising daily; I was still behaving like a university student even without the exam at the end! Not only the theory is really detailed, but the coursework in Matlab allowed me to understand what\u2019s going on under the hood. Given that I was already a heavy Matlab user, due to its usage throughout my entire academic journey, I could focus on the ML section.\\n\\nAfter this course, I knew that I had learnt a lot, but I also knew that if I wanted to use ML for real-applications, I\u2019d have to learn Python. Given that I knew Matlab, I choose to start reading a python book that had Data Science application in mind. Hence, I started reading **\u201cPython Data Science Handbook\u201d**. This, along with several hours of practicing on available datasets, has taught me pretty much all I know about Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. Although this book also contains a last chapter with ML algorithms, these are rather brief.\\n\\n> _In my previous job at Nurvv, where I worked as Sensor Fusion Engineer, I developed a python analysis tool that parsed all the raw data from a running session and conveyed that information into meaningful plots. This allowed us to analyse whether a run was successful from the Firmware side of things, and this was critical for our development. This tool was created mainly from the knowledged gathered from the book mentioned above._\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nFollowing this, I was rather confident with my Python skills. Therefore, I wanted to crack-on learning how to use ML algorithms with Python through the beauty of imports. It comes without saying that I had to start from the best-seller **\u201cHands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow\u201d**. This book was what I was expecting and more. From time to time, when I\u2019m working on personal projects, I still flick through it. This book also allowed me to develop many more personal projects (most of them public in [my GitHub](https://github.com/DidierRLopes), as I\u2019m a big Open-Source fan \u2014 you should know that as I made [Gamestonk Terminal](https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal) repository public).\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-11-07-the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey_2.png)\\n\\nThe project that has been my biggest challenge was working with a friend on his PhD thesis entitled _\u201cModelling and Forecasting of Time-Series: A data science approach that compares classic methodologies with deep learning methodologies\u201d_. Not only interpreting and discussing results but writing the code behind it. S/O to the resources: **\u201cForecasting: Principles and Practice\u201d** and **\u201chttps://machinelearningmastery.com\u201d**. Without these, this work would have been much harder.\\n\\nThroughout my short journey, I followed many people related with DS. People that I thought that in some shape or form added value through their posts. One of these, was Andriy Burkov. I remember when he started talking about creating the **\u201cThe Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book\u201d** and specifically, I remember his Linkedin\'s poll to select the colour of one of the bubbles for his books\' cover. I voted purple; the result was yellow. So, I took the freedom to fix the cover of his book, as you can see below.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-11-07-the-start-of-my-machine-learning-journey_3.png)\\n\\nMy gecko Reidid on \u201cThe Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book\u201d\u200b, in order to keep industry standards of ML books with reptiles.\\n\\nI really enjoyed his book since it can explain everything, while keeping it simple and short. As I learned at University, _Keep It Simple, Stupid_. Also, his book is distributed in a \u201cread first, buy later\u201d principle. This meant that I was able to flick through the content of the book before buying it. Personally, I think this should be adopted more often, at least for technical books.\\n\\nFinally, last summer, while on holiday in Portugal, I read **\u201cApproaching (almost) any machine learning\u201d**, which I found to be great for people that have read about the theory but were wondering where/how to apply it.\\n\\nThe next ML books in my list are:\\n- **Deep Learning** \u2014 Aaron Courville, Ian Goodfellow, and Yoshua Bengio\\n- **The Elements of Statistical Learning** \u2014 Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani e Trevor Hastie\\n- **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning** \u2014 Christopher Bishop\\n- **Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms** \u2014 Shai Ben-David and Shai Shalev-Shwartz\\n\\nLet me know if you think these are good books, or if there are others that you\u2019d recommend."},{"id":"an-unusual-journey-learning-about-nns-for-a-phd-thesis","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/an-unusual-journey-learning-about-nns-for-a-phd-thesis","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2021-10-22-an-unusual-journey-learning-about-nns-for-a-phd-thesis.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-22-an-unusual-journey-learning-about-nns-for-a-phd-thesis.md","title":"An unusual journey learning about NNs for a PhD thesis","description":"An unusual journey of learning about Neural Networks for a PhD thesis.

Since time series prediction was always a topic that I found fascinating and hadn\u2019t had time to study, I thought this would be the perfect timing to do so.\\n\\nSo from February 2019 onwards, this exciting journey started. I was working full-time so in order to be able to take part in this, I was only sleeping 4/5h a day. I started reading a lot of books and practicing my python coding skills in order to be more helpful. Then around June, we started working together on the code. We had around 2\u20133h discussions a couple times a week where we would discuss the point of the situation code-wise and where we wanted to be, we kept in touch about this every day.\\n\\nFrom the repo, which is open source [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/UnivariateTimeSeriesForecast), you can see that we explored: Exploratory Data Analysis; ARIMA and SARIMA; Exponential Smoothing; Deep Neural Network. The final part of this work consisted in an innovative approach to tackle an univariate time series, which you can find [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/UnivariateTimeSeriesForecast/blob/master/DNN_ourApproach.ipynb). On top of that, a library of cross-validation for Neural Networks was developed, which is now being used in real data science applications, see [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/timeseries-cv).\\n\\nThe work, which took around 1 year to complete, can be divided into 3 distinct phases:\\n\\n- The **coding** phase lasted around 3 months. I would write the code, test the code and then touch base with Filipe to ensure we were going in the right direction.\\n- The **tweaking and analysis phase** took around another 3 months. Here, Filipe took the code I had completed and analysed multiple time series with different trends and seasonalities; tweaked different models; trained and validated these; and started interpreting results. In this phase, me and Filipe would discuss the code from a pragmatic point of view, and improve it based on what Filipe wanted to see/analyse. This phase was so intense that Filipe flew out to London twice to meet me, almost over a period of 1 month.\\n- The **writing of the thesis phase** took an additional 6 months. Here Filipe basically translated the results and analysis seen on the notebook of the thesis, wrote a full theoretical background on the models used and interpreted the applicability of these.\\n\\nThe full work, _\u201cData Science in the Modeling and Forecasting of Financial timeseries: from Classic methodologies to Deep Learning\u201d_, can be found in [here](https://ciencia.iscte-iul.pt/publications/data-science-na-modelacao-e-previsao-de-series-economico-financeiras-das-metodologias-classicas-ao/82703) or stored in [here](https://repositorio.iscte-iul.pt/handle/10071/22964).\\n\\nDuring this time, Filipe was also working full-time as he was a teaching assistant in three different universities. In spite of the adversities, Filipe achieved an impressive approved with \u201c_unanimous distinction_\u201d (maximum classification) from ISCTE Business School, Lisbon, Portugal.\\n\\nMy character waiting for people to join my chatroom to discuss our poster.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-10-22-an-unusual-journey-learning-about-nns-for-a-phd-thesis_1.png)\\n\\nLast week, at XXV Congress of the Portuguese Statistical Society (SPE 2021), we presented:\\n\\n- A poster that you can find [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355360806_Forecasting_models_for_time-series_a_comparative_study_between_classical_methodologies_and_Deep_Learning), titled: _\u201cForecasting models for time-series: a comparative study between classical methodologies and Deep Learning\u201d_\\n- A presentation that you can find [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355360897_Explorando_o_poder_da_memoria_das_redes_neuronais_LSTM_na_modelacao_e_previsao_do_PSI_20), titled: _\u201cExplorando o poder da mem\xf3ria das redes neuronais LSTM na modela\xe7\xe3o e previs\xe3o do PSI 20\u201d_\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-10-22-an-unusual-journey-learning-about-nns-for-a-phd-thesis_2.png)\\n\\nThe poster above was presented at XXV Congress of the Portuguese Statistical Society (SPE 2021).\\n\\nI started this journey with my previous maths teacher and ended it with a close friend!

I\u2019ve observed that more and more people are trying to innovate and create their own pieces of art. Some of them are impressive, some of them aren\u2019t. But,\\n\\n> _Beauty is in the eye of the beholder \u2014 Margaret Wolfe Hungerford_\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nHowever, in my humble opinion, what distinguishes some art from others, is most of the time not the art itself but the community around it. For example, when everyone starts talking about the \u2018new best thing\u2019 you feel more pressure to get involved.\\n\\nBecause of this dynamic, creators are investing in ways to increase their collectibles popularity by building their community. A great example is [ParallelNFT](https://parallel.life/) and the dystopic story that is being created around their cards \u2014 in their case, it\u2019s fairly easy to understand that once a big community is formed around such cards, video games, movies and even series are on the table. For the first time ever, we would go from selling collectibles to creating some form of entertainment. A whole new industry in the making.\\n\\nHowever, not every digital creator has the resources to create a full concept around their cards. Does this mean that they can\u2019t create a community around it? No. But they must find other ways. One of the most popular ways I\u2019ve seen is through giveaways. Similar to what small clothing brands do to increase their popularity. This is a great tactic in my opinion, since giveaway not only give you a bigger audience (people that participate and re-share content) but it makes the cards have multiple owners. This, as a result, makes the collection more attractive for NFT collectors.\\n\\n_When demand exceeds supply_, **prices tend to rise.**\\n\\nAnd these creators are using Reddit as the platform of their giveaways.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-09-30-how-i-created-a-bot-in-python-to-participate-in-nft-giveaways_1.png)\\n\\nWhen scrolling through reddit you will notice that all these posts have certain things in common:\\n- They ask for an up-vote on the post\\n- A comment with your wallet address\\n- To favourite their artwork\\n- They may also ask to you to join their Discord\\n- For a follow on their Twitter or Instagram\\n- If you can retweet or share a story\\n\\nThese are things that take time, and a bot can perfectly do this. Therefore, I wrote a [giveaway NFT bot](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GiveawayNFTbot) to simplify my work. Now I just sit down and read robot vacuum reviews while the bot: upvotes, comments and opens their Opensea link for me to favourite their artwork.\\n\\nI\u2019ve already won multiple NFTs with this, which is exciting\u2014 you never know where the next [CryptoPunks](https://twitter.com/cryptopunksbot) are at.\\n\\nThere\u2019s actually 1 collection that I particularly like and believe has a lot of potential, it\u2019s called [CryptoCartoonEaters](https://opensea.io/collection/crypto-cartooneaters) and due to the uniqueness of each collectible (only 100 made), I really think it has a great potential. I acquired my favourite cartoon as a kid: Goku Eating a Burger.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-09-30-how-i-created-a-bot-in-python-to-participate-in-nft-giveaways_2.png)\\n\\nLet me know if you find this article interesting, and if you used the bot as well!"},{"id":"gamestonk-terminal-cant-stop-won-t-stop","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/gamestonk-terminal-cant-stop-won-t-stop","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2021-09-16-gamestonk-terminal-cant-stop-won-t-stop.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-16-gamestonk-terminal-cant-stop-won-t-stop.md","title":"Gamestonk Terminal \u2014 Can\u2019t Stop, Won\u2019t Stop","description":"Gamestonk Terminal\'s latest updates including Docker integration, Jupyter Lab integration, a new Hugo website, and new features.

IMDbPy API in Python.\\n\\nThe open source code is available [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/SortMoviesPerRating).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid

decided that it was time to find something worth watching.\\n\\nAlthough there\u2019s lots of tempting series out there, we didn\u2019t want to follow that path as we don\u2019t like the \u201caddiction\u201d effect that a series has. Also, we have the same taste regarding movies, where **we both enjoy complex thriller plots**, that leave your mind to resonate about them long after being done with it. Personally, I consider a movie great when it still crosses my mind when trying to sleep or the day after. So, thriller movies it was.\\n\\nAfter doing a little research work I came across this list of movies on Reddit: [99 mind f*ck movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/geipee/99_mindfck_movies/). I knew this list was good because most of my favourite movies were there, e.g. _The Prestige, Inception, The Usual Suspects, Primal Fear_, and _Ex Machina_.\\n\\nSo, the movie list was decided, and with that, also our new year\u2019s resolution.\\n\\nHowever, this list had 2 issues:\\n\\n**1. The list didn\u2019t have any particular order.** We would like to have the list ranked from best to worst, so that watching the best ones first will keep our motivation levels up to finish the list.\\n\\n**2. The movie title didn\u2019t have the released year.** Although we don\u2019t particularly mind old movies, sometimes we\u2019re just not in the mood to watch a B&W screen, or poor image resolution.\\n\\nTherefore, while Meg was busy, I was on a role to hack something that would both sort the list based on IMDB ranking, and add the release years to the titles.\\n\\nIn a couple of minutes, I was already playing with [IMDbPy API](https://imdbpy.github.io/). This allowed me to have the sorting algorithm running in the background pretty quick. Within the hour, we already had our sorted movie list. Which I have attached below for future reference.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-08-15-ranking-99-mind-f-ck-movies_1.png)\\n\\nThe first movie of the list that none of us had already watched was the movie [Incendies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1255953/). After having watched this movie, I can already tell you that sorting out this list was worth it. Definitely mind blowing, and a great watch.\\n\\nAs usual, you can find the source code on my github: [SortMoviesPerRating](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/SortMoviesPerRating).\\n\\nHope you enjoyed this read!"},{"id":"k-means-clustering-to-visit-a-new-city","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/k-means-clustering-to-visit-a-new-city","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2021-08-01-k-means-clustering-to-visit-a-new-city.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-01-k-means-clustering-to-visit-a-new-city.md","title":"K-means algorithm to visit a new city","description":"In this blogpost, I share how I used the K-means algorithm to plan a visit to London.

The algorithm helps to decide which attractions to visit based on the number of days of the visit and the GPS coordinates of the attractions.\\n\\nThe open source code is available [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/LondonVisit).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nUsually when I book a weekend getaway, I spend quite some time doing 2 things:\\n\\n- Writing down the main attractions I want to see\\n- Depicting the travel path to maximise efficiency and see the most in less time (I\u2019m a bit of an efficiency freak myself, sorry)\\n\\n**This repository aims to decide which attractions to visit in London as a function of the number of days that you will be visiting, by applying K-means algorithm.**\\n\\nAs input you need to give the GPS coordinates of the main attractions you want to visit during your stay, and the number of days you are planning to visit. Notice that attractions that are not within the map screenshot boundaries will be discarded. See disclaimer below.\\n\\nThe K-means algorithm will interpret: List of GPS coordinates of the main attractions that you want to visit as 2D samples, after converting to UTM. Number of days of the visit as Number of clusters.\\n\\nOf course, this is rather unrealistic because of several reasons, such as:\\n\\n- Not taking into account if they want to just pass by the London Eye, or have a ride on it;\\n- Assumes that we are in a no man\u2019s land since it completely bypasses the existence of other buildings, roads, \u2026;\\n- Does not consider altitude, even though London is rather plane;\\n- Does not consider the number of attractions that one can possibly do per day;\\n- Plus, if there was to be an attraction really far from the centre, it may happen that the algorithm considers an entire day for it (this would depend upon kernel initialisation)\\n\\nNonetheless, I think this is a funny exercise, and if I were to select the areas to visit by myself, **it would most likely be a similar choice to the one taken by K-means**.\\n\\n**Disclaimer**: I did not know how to use Google API (neither wanted to pay for a key to be fair) hence I just took a screenshot of google maps and wrote down the coordinate of the lower left corner, so that I could use it as my origin. I also took the right top corner coordinate so that I could give the map with an \u201caccurate\u201d scaling.\\n\\n**Note**: GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) have degrees has units, thus, explaining why the conversion to UTM coordinates, which uses meters.\\n\\nImmediately below you can see the result of a visit to London for 2, 3 and 4 days.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-08-01-k-means-clustering-to-visit-a-new-city_1.png)\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex justify-center gap-2\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2021-08-01-k-means-clustering-to-visit-a-new-city_2.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" />\\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2021-08-01-k-means-clustering-to-visit-a-new-city_3.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" /> \\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThis project was done for fun. However, I believe that by creating a tuple per location with coordinates and estimate of time taken on each attraction, something nice could come out of this.\\n\\nHope you find this interesting.

Therefore, that year during Christmas, I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could find any interesting project to do in only 1 week.\\n\\nI started by nagging my dad and brother for them to tell me something that would be useful to them in their daily lives. Sadly, none of them had any idea. Then, I went to the kitchen to ask my mum the same. She was busy searching recipes for xmas on her messy notebook, so she also said no.\\n\\nI sat there next to her thinking about what I could do, while she kept on going back and forth in her notebook searching. I don\u2019t know if she had been reading about the binary search algorithm, or if she was just opening pages randomly. What I know is that 1 week later I did a program for her to keep her recipes. Safe to say that I saved Christmas, I guess.\\n\\nNote: Before the end of that year, I still upgraded the software for its version 2.0, which included more than 20 minion icons. To this day, I think she opens the program to see the minion icons more than the recipes themselves.\\n\\nBelow it displays the interfaces used, and these correspond to: Red-Visualize; Add; Blue-Add; Green-Edit; and Yellow-Remove recipes.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-07-23-minion-recipes-program_1.png)\\n\\nPS: Any resemblance with the Microsoft colour scheme is pure coincidence eheh.\\n\\nWhen adding a recipe, the following window will be displayed.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-07-23-minion-recipes-program_2.png)\\n\\nThis allows you to add both a recipe, and a category (i.e. the \u201cTiramisu\u201d recipe would be within \u201cDesserts\u201d category).\\n\\nThe recipe content would include:\\n\\n- Name of the recipe\\n- Ingredients\\n- Preparation\\n- Comment\\n\\nWhen visualising a recipe, the following window will be displayed.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-07-23-minion-recipes-program_3.png)\\n\\nWhere the recipe dialog box would prompt the recipes based on the category chosen on its left. Then, after selecting a recipe, the ingredients, preparation and comment would be filled out.\\n\\nWhen editing a recipe, the following window will be displayed. This is similar to the visualisation window, with the difference that the text boxes are editable, and therefore, the recipe can be improved.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-07-23-minion-recipes-program_4.png)\\n\\nNote: throughout the program there are Message Dialog boxes (as shown above) that tell the user whether the recipe has been successfully (or not) edited, added or removed.\\n\\nFinally, in order to remove a recipe, the following window would be displayed. Where you can either delete a single recipe, or the entire category.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-07-23-minion-recipes-program_5.png)\\n\\nThe recipe database is handled in the most robust way: **with plain text files**, obviously.\\n\\nAs always, hope you had a nice read."},{"id":"household-bills-program","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/household-bills-program","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2021-07-17-household-bills-program.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-17-household-bills-program.md","title":"Household bills Program","description":"In this blogpost, I share my journey of creating a program to split household bills.

I was a decent player I\'d say, you can see a compilation of \\"almosts\\" I\'ve done [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocsJzNJJB50).\\n\\nHowever, I knew this wasn\'t the way. I realised that if I used the amount of time I was spending on online games for learning, I would have a much bigger satisfaction return. And, in the long term, my life would be better.\\n\\n**So I started studying hard.** I started valuing my time more, and declined most of the parties I was invited to because I was busy working late hours. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m an easy person. I like to think I make friends easily. However, I just had different priorities, and partying just wasn\'t one of them. As my parents say: _\\"Everything has its own time\\"_.\\n\\nIn my 2nd year of University, I was getting really good grades, which means that I started having discussions with the other best students in the course. **That\'s how I met one of the smartest people I know to this day**. This guy was a proper hands-on person, he didn\'t study half the time I did, but he was always busy with something.\\n\\nHe had a band, developed his own personalised guitar pedals and amplifiers, and developed some apps for fun. He did this all while having excellent results at University, which is insane. That\'s when I realised that he was not only giving more priority to these hobbies in relation to partying or meeting people, **BUT also in relation to doing courseworks or studying for exams**. He\'d never fail a coursework/exam, but that further study could have bumped a grade from 17 to a 19 out of 20.\\n\\nOne day, we were meant to meet at his place to work on a coursework together, and he shown me an app that he had developed for him and his girlfriend. The app was a simple command line interface that was able to split their usual household bills (rent, water bill, food shop, cat food, etc). **I found that fascinating.**\\n\\nI told him I would create one for myself. Since I had read about how to use Java to make a pretty GUI, I thought why not give this a go (although I had no idea about OOP). In addition, I didn\'t want my program to look the same as his, so I thought my version could be as if it was an upgrade.\\n\\n...\\n\\nAfter that, I was on a mission. Little did I know that after this, I never really stopped having an interest in working on new side projects.\\n\\nThe planning steps were:\\n\\n**1. Decide main features.**\\n  Add new household bills to split, Give money, and See bills.\\n\\n**2.Sketch what the GUI should look like**\\n\\n**3. Devise data structure associated with a new Household bill split.**\\n  This was important for both coding, and also database management.\\n\\n**4. Work out the math associated with the splitting and giving**\\n\\nThe development process was to **\\"divide to conquer\\"**. I split the tasks into several sub-tasks, and after every new little code change I was testing the code to make sure that nothing was broken. I re-iterate through design and code several times, until I was happy with my solution. Then I did some clean-up/improvements, such as: Adding pictures of the users, Login password, Frenchies as icons.\\n\\n**On a funny side note:** As I didn\'t know how to work with DBs at that time, I used text files to save and load all the information. Meaning that if my brother ever opened one of those text files (which weren\'t properly hidden...), I could have passed from him owing me 100 euros to me owing him 10 million. The software was on his laptop, and I had an hardcoded password, so in theory he couldn\'t manually add any bill without my presence -- I guess that was enough for him to think that the product was bullet-proof.\\n\\nSee images below of the program:\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex justify-center gap-2\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2021-07-17-household-bills-program_1.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" />\\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2021-07-17-household-bills-program_2.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" /> \\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<div className=\\"flex justify-center gap-2\\">\\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2021-07-17-household-bills-program_3.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" />\\n  <img src=\\"/blog/2021-07-17-household-bills-program_4.png\\" width=\\"50%\\" /> \\n</div>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nYou can find more information about this on my GitHub, [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/HouseholdBills).\\n\\n**The program ended up being used for more than 3 years.** Since I lived with other people other than my brother, I had to update the name/image on the program to represent that. Since I was new to coding, I didn\'t think about the future. Therefore, when that time came, I had to manually replace the names one by one in the code. I also had friends requesting to use the program, which lead to me adapting this to their names/figures.\\n\\nIt was a fun project and I definitely learned loads from it. The most important thing was that I was able to do whatever **I wanted software-wise as long as I dedicated enough time for it.**\\n\\nHope you had a fun read.

I won\'t go into too much detail about the book which is a great read, if you don\'t trust me, trust Bill Gates, who called the book \\"_absolutely phenomenal_\\"\\". But let me give you a brief sequence of events from the author and journalist of the book, Joshua Foer:\\n\\n- It starts by observing the extraordinary accomplishments of mental athletes at a memory championship.\\n- Foer meets Tony Buzan, the trim 67-year-old English self-help guru who founded the [World Memory Championships](http://www.worldmemorychampionships.com/) in 1991 and who insists the brain is \\"like a muscle\\": exercise it and it gets stronger.\\n- Foer learns the art of memory training.\\n- He practices his memory muscles for 1 year with help of a shambling 24-year-old from Oxford who becomes his mentor.\\n- He then finds himself in the finals of the US Memory Championships, alongside \'mental athletes\' who could memorise the precise order of ten shuffled decks of cards in under an hour.\\n\\nIf you\'re interested, here\'s a [nice review](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/nov/21/moonwalking-einstein-joshua-foer-review) on the book.\\n\\n## My thoughts after reading book\\n\\nAfter finishing this book, more than anything I was curious. Unlike Joshua Foer, I didn\'t want to dedicate a full year to the cause, but I still wanted to give it a go so I could look back and think: \\"Here\'s something pretty useless for the day-to-day. Yet, how cool is that I can memorise 52 random cards?\\"\\".\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-06-26-my-journey-of-memorising-a-deck-of-52-shuffled-cards_1.png)\\n\\nFor people who know me, they know how much I hate to leave things unfinished. Whether that\'s a task that I set myself, or \'just\' not leaving any pizza leftover. Therefore, I knew that if I really wanted to do this, I\'d have to set aside time for it, and so I did. The text under is my journey to memorise a shuffled deck of 52 cards.\\n\\n## Technique (PAO + Memory Palace)\\n\\nThe mnemonic \\"**Memory Palace**\\" technique that I was about to use was referred to on the aforementioned book. The ancient mnemonic technique was first practiced by Simonides of Ceos over 2,500 years ago. When googling the term, the definition is:\\n\\n_A Memory Palace is an imaginary location in your mind where you can store mnemonic images. The most common type of memory palace involves making a journey through a place you know well, like a building or town. Along that journey there are specific locations that you always visit in the same order._\\n\\nThe mnemonic images would be conceived using the famous PAO system. This term means:\\n\\n_The Person-Action-Object System (or \\"PAO\\" System) is a popular method for memorising long random numbers and decks of playing cards. \u2026 Some people assign arbitrary images to the numbers without any phonetic conversion. The digits are usually chunked in 2 or 3 digits and then placed into loci in a Memory Palace._\\n\\nThe idea is to take advantage of what we humans are best at, photographic memory.\\n\\n## The journey of memorising a shuffled deck of 52 cards\\n\\n### 1. Create your own personal PAO system.\\n\\nFor each card of the deck you have to have an associated _Person_, _Action_ and _Object_. It\'s useful to have the least possible rules, and have these intersecting simultaneous cards, so that there\'s less to memorise. Here\'s how I did it:\\n\\n- Define a **category** for each **suit** (e.g. Hearts represents friends)\\n- Define **something** for each **type**.\\n    - From 1 to 10 I\'ve defined the starting letter of the person (e.g. Card 7 represents a person with name starting with letter K or C).\\n    - For the court (Queen, Jack, King) I\'ve defined them as a powerful male/female. (e.g. King is the GOAT of the category).\\n\\nBelow you can see what the table looks like:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-06-26-my-journey-of-memorising-a-deck-of-52-shuffled-cards_2.png)\\n\\n**Note:** The Person is the main existing link, hence it needs to be something that you think of immediately when the category and the type of the card is known.\\n\\nI had to change my cards several times as some of the PAO\'s I had weren\'t memorable enough, either because the name was too common, or because I didn\'t relate that much to this person.\\n\\n### 2. Memorise each card with it\'s PAO system\\n\\nOnce the table above is filled in, the next step is to associate each card with it\'s **Person-Action-Object**. I find that as long as you can remember the person name of the card by doing the cross between category and type, the action-object comes easily.\\n\\nFor instance:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-06-26-my-journey-of-memorising-a-deck-of-52-shuffled-cards_3.png)\\n\\n**Jack \u2666: Einstein \u2014 Writing Equations \u2014 Blackboard**\\n\\n- When I see a **Diamond**, I know we are in the **Celebrities** category. Since this is a **Jack** I know it\'s an **important person**. I\'ve selected Musk to be my GOAT, so this has to be **Einstein**. The **writing equations** and **blackboard** comes trivially when thinking about Einstein.\\n\\n**8 \u2663: Floyd Mayweather \u2014 Skipping \u2014 Rope**\\n\\n- When a **Club** appears, I know we are in the **Athletes** category. Since this is an **8** I know the name starts with an **F or V**. This promptly reminds me of **Floyd**. The **skipping** and **rope** come immediately, due to my own personal experiences from improving my skipping skills and looking at videos of Mayweather. I find that the more the personal and creative you get with this, the easier it is to remember.\\n\\n**King \u2660: Goku \u2014 Powering up \u2014 Blonde Hair**\\n\\n- If I see a **Spade**, I know we are in the **Cartoon** category. Since this is a King I know that this character is the **GOAT**. Which immediately triggers my brain to Goku, since it used to be my favourite cartoon as a kid. Trivially, comes the powering up as action, and the blonde hair as object.\\n\\nIn order to remember all the cards, my trick was to have a deck of cards where on the back of each card I wrote its own PAO. So that if I didn\'t remember, instead of looking at the table, I could look at the back of the card. However, I find it important to sometimes not quit trying to remember immediately, as when you initially struggle to remember a card, when you eventually do, your brain retains this information so much better.\\n\\n**Note: At this step you may realise that you keep forgetting the same PAO card. I recommend you going back to step 1 and re-defining it.** Once I did this to the cards I kept forgetting, I was in a much better position.\\n\\n### 3. Create your own memory palace\\n\\nThis is the easiest step. I used the house I grew up in in Portugal, and decided to place 4 PAO instruments (i.e. 12 cards) per house division. Meaning that by the time I was in the first room upstairs, I was already 36 cards down the deck.\\n\\nSince I\'m not living in Portugal, let me show you what I mean by using a picture of my current living room in London. The spots I would select in here would have been: 1. Top of table with candles; 2. Top of side table; 3. Inside my gecko\'s vivarium; 4. As a program on the TV.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-06-26-my-journey-of-memorising-a-deck-of-52-shuffled-cards_4.png)\\n\\n**Note: Make sure you always remember your memory palace spots, otherwise you may overlook them once looking for the next 3 set of cards.** The way I think about this is imagining that I lost my keys, and mentally going back in time to try to understand where they could be.\\n\\n### 4. Practice memorising each set of 3 cards PAO\\n\\nThis is where the creativity comes in. **When picking 3 cards from the deck, you picture the Person of the 1st card, the Action of the 2nd one, and the Object of the 3rd one.**\\n\\nLet\'s imagine we\'ve got the cards aforementioned.\\n\\n**- Card 1: Jack \u2666**\\n  * Einstein \u2014 Writing Equations \u2014 Blackboard\\n\\n**- Card 2: 8 \u2663**\\n  * Floyd Mayweather \u2014 Skipping \u2014 Rope\\n\\n**- Card 3: King \u2660**\\n  * Goku \u2014 Powering up \u2014 Blonde Hair\\n\\nIn my brain, this would lead to\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-06-26-my-journey-of-memorising-a-deck-of-52-shuffled-cards_5.png)\\n\\n**Note: At this point you may realise that some combos of cards don\'t work well together. **If this is bad enough to not make you remember the 3 card PAO, I recommend updating your PAO system to something that\'s easier to generalise.\\n\\n### 5. Place each 3 cards PAO onto the memory palace\\n\\nFor instance, if I were to place the **Einstein Skipping with Blonde Hair** on the **3rd spot of my living room (my gecko\'s vivarium)**, in my head, I would picture something like this:\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-06-26-my-journey-of-memorising-a-deck-of-52-shuffled-cards_6.png)\\n\\n**Note: I recommend trying to have the 3 card PAO interacting with the environment to improve memory.** In this case, I would have thought about the Blonde Skipping Einstein having to do skipping so fast that the gecko coudn\'t come close because the rope was going too fast. The more original/different, the more chances you have to remember this scenario.\\n\\n### 6. Re-iterate the memory palace with new 3 card PAO every time\\n\\nInstead of memorising a new 3 card PAO in a memory palace location and then moving on, I always go back to the start and think about all the previous 3 card PAO\'s from start. This will ensure you don\'t forget the oldest 3 card PAO. In fact, it will make it so that the oldest 3 card PAO are repeated more times than the newer ones, so it\'s all balanced out.\\n\\n### 7. Practice and Practice\\n\\nI found out that after memorising my PAO system (which took a long time) and the memory palace, it was fairly easy to memorise the shuffled 52 deck of cards. However, it was taking me way too long to memorise it AND say it out loud.\\n\\nOnce I started practicing more and more time started decreasing. The last time I tried, I managed to do it under 10 minutes, which is not great but I\'ll take it. As I mentioned, I just wanted to be able to do it, I didn\'t care much about the time.\\n\\nAlso, I still needed to think about the category + type of the card every-time, I think the time to memorise the deck of cards decreases exponentially once you actually associate each card image to it\'s PAO. But for that you need to practice more, which for me was getting boring.\\n\\n...\\n\\nThis is a different post than the ones I usually do, but I find it extremely interesting. Hence why I was keen on sharing it.\\n\\nLet me know if you\'ve heard about it, or want to give this a go.\\n\\nThanks for reading!"},{"id":"customizable-meme-filter","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/customizable-meme-filter","editUrl":"https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/tree/main/blog/2021-06-12-customizable-meme-filter.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-06-12-customizable-meme-filter.md","title":"Customizable Meme Filter","description":"In this blogpost, I share my journey of creating a customizable meme filter using Python.

This filter selects a random meme based on the number of people on the screen and assigns each person to a character in the meme.\\n\\nThe open source code is available [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/meme-filter).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nFor the people who know me, they know how much I enjoy memes. I\u2019ve got to admit, whenever I go to museums I have a lot of fun captioning artwork as memes. **As I like to say, I go for the art, and I stay for the memes.**\\n\\nOne day while commuting to work (you can still see the [first commit](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/meme-filter/commit/59be427571c96350d9652922b3ab2ba52ddf18af) which dates back to 10 February of 2020 and has only notes of the sketch of this idea in Portuguese) I thought:\\n\\n> \u201cIt would be funny if there was a snapchat kind of filter where given the number of people on the screen, a random meme was selected and each person would be one of its characters\u201d.\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nSince I was still improving my Python skills, I thought why not do it in Python. After 1 month, I already had the working code, however, since I was switching jobs at the time my commute time reduced drastically and so did my time to work on this. It took around 1 more month to finish the cleaning up of the script (324 lines) to be more readable, and at the same time Covid happened. **The latter explains why my hair is blonde on the demo below** :)\\n\\nUsage:\\n\\n```console\\n./didifilter.py \u2014 location=memes \u2014 caption=\u2019Which meme am I?\u2019 \u2014 initial=30 \u2014 final=50 -b \u2014 max=3\\n```\\n\\n![hair_1](/blog/2021-06-12-customizable-meme-filter_1.png)\\n\\n**To sum up:** This program is meant to be an advanced version of the known snapchat filter where there are random images spinning on top of people\u2019s heads. The main improvement is that you can not only select the images you want to choose from and the caption, but you can also play it with friends (recognizing more than 1 face at the same time).\\n\\nThe best part of the script is that it is meant to be easily customizable. Any person is able to create their own filter by creating a folder with the images they want within a folder with 1, 2, \u2026 based on the number of people they are meant to be used (apart from when backwardCompatible flag is enabled), and select/specify different types of flags/parameters, e.g.:\\n\\n```console\\n./didifilter.py \u2014 locationFolder=celebrities \u2014 caption=\u2019What celeb am I?\u2019 \u2014 max=2 -v \u2014 video=\u201dexampleVideo\u201d\\n```\\n\\n```console\\n./didifilter.py --locationFolder=pokemons --caption=\\"Who\'s this pokemon?\\" --width=250 --height=150 --max=1 -p\\n```\\n\\n**AND**, you can also quickly tweak the code to adapt it to do something else. Here\u2019s me **pranking** my girlfriend with a psyduck when the query was: \u201c_Who do I look like?_\u201d\\n\\n![hair_2](/blog/2021-06-12-customizable-meme-filter_2.png)\\n\\nHope you have a nice read and enjoy the filter.

The logo and name is inspired by the Neist Point Lighthouse in the Isle of Skye. The motto was \u201c**For a greener future and a bluer ocean**\u201d, and the goal was to raise awareness to contribute for a sustainable environment.\\n\\nAt **Neist**, we tried to not be yet another clothing brand, but actually to fill the current gap in the retail industry by producing high-quality, eco-friendly clothes at affordable prices. And we achieved that. For instance, our t-shirts are made of 100% organic ring-spun combed cotton, and they last longer than my Lacoste t-shirts \u2014 seriously.\\n\\nThe problem is that to be profitable, you need to either increase the prices of your products, or decrease the quality, which were not things we wanted to do since they didn\u2019t represent the value of our brand. Due to that, and the fact that the team behind our brand no longer has time/resources, we\u2019re dropping our **last ever** season now.\\n\\nAnyway, no regrets from my side, it has been a great learning experience to understand what is involved around the creation of a brand, being a project manager internally, and doing something other than coding in my spare time. _Also, most importantly, ending up with a full new wardrobe of pieces that I love and that will probably last for my kids._\\n\\nSorry for this rambling, just wanted to share this context with everyone.\\n\\n## Implementation\\n\\nGiven that our team had no experience in clothing whatsoever, and based on our needs, our steps to make this a high-quality product were:\\n\\n1. Get the best (environmentaly friendly) clothing material\\n2. Send it to the best embroidery store in Portugal\\n3. Package it and forward it onto the customer\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-05-23-neistpoint-project_1.png)\\n\\nThis process was **far from being optimised**. In fact, pretty much everything was manual. Apart from the creation of the clothes. Therefore, we needed a Software to keep track of the products at each of it\u2019s stages: _material to request, material shipping, material in stock, product to create, product creating, product in stock, and product sent_.\\n\\nSince I didn\u2019t find anything that I liked online, and I knew how to code, I thought the best solution was to develop something myself. This way it could be adapted to perfectly fit my own requirements (advantages of being your own product owner eheh). In addition, I wanted to improve my C++ skills, so I thought, **why not?**\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-05-23-neistpoint-project_2.png)\\n\\nFor 1 week or so, during my commute I worked on the [NeistPoint Stock Managemen](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/NeistpointCLI) tool. To be honest, I think it took longer to devise the architecture behind it than to actually write the code, as there were lots of things that I wanted to be taken into account. Also, the fact that the \u201cdatabase\u201d is a .csv file, was intentional. This way, we could share this file between the team members.\\n\\nHope someone finds this tool interesting, and gets inspired to develop their own software to meet their own project requirements.

Checking the next fixtures for a specific competition: https://www.skysports.com/premier-league-fixtures\\n2. Checking the last results of each of the team and \u201cestimate\u201d their momentum (e.g. https://www.skysports.com/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-vs-liverpool/stats/429116)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nThen, iterate these 2 steps for all the fixtures happening, from Premier League, Championship, League One, and League Two.\\n\\nSince I recently learned how to use Beautiful Soup to scrap data from web pages (see [GamestonkTerminal](https://dro-lopes.medium.com/gamestonk-terminal-the-next-best-thing-after-bloomberg-terminal-a263c001a61f)), I thought that I could create an automated task that would do all of these steps with a simple double click executable. After checking that I could extract such data from SkySports, I let him know that by the next day I would have something working.\\n\\nAfter dinner, I started working on the project, and before I went to sleep I had the first prototype working, which you can see in [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/momentum-football-bets).\\n\\nOn top of \u201chis\u201d automated task, I created a \u201cmomentum score\u201d which tries to estimate the momentum score based on what my girlfriend\u2019s father told me that he does. He looks into the last games of the team and see if they have a positive momentum by looking to see if they come from a winning series.\\n\\nSo, I thought it would be good to attribute a weight to each of the last matches where the most recent match would have the biggest weight, and last one from the 6 provided from SkySports stats would have the lowest weight. Together with this weight, I thought we could use the sum of the weight to the score in case of a win, subtract in case of loss, and don\u2019t do anything in case of a draw.\\n\\nSo, in simple terms, if score is positive the team is likely to have been winning their last matches, if score is negative the team is likely to have loss their last matches.\\n\\nBut then, I thought:\\n\\n_\u201cOk, this is nice. But when you bet, you don\u2019t bet on a single team, but on the result between the 2 teams that are playing each other.\u201d_ I.e. if team A has an amazing momentum, and so has team B, the bet will \u2014 in theory \u2014 be risky.\\n\\nHence, the next step was to address this concern. This was done by checking the momentum score difference between the teams, the bigger the momentum score, the less risky \u2014 in theory \u2014 a bet would be. What we want to see is a team that has been doing amazing for the past 6 games, and one that has been performing consistently bad.\\n\\nLastly, I added a confidence filter so that the terminal would only output the games that shown at least a certain X confidence. And also, an argument that would select the number of days in the future that we could look for fixtures.\\n\\nAfter having this implemented, the day after was about polishing the code, adding some colouring and emojis, creating a repository for it, a README, discussing the binning of the momentum score and bet confidence terms, creating a logo for it, and creating an executable + adding the logo which my girlfriend did.\\n\\n![image](/blog/2021-04-07-momentum-football-bets_1.png)\\n\\nAfter this, we were quite excited to backtest the app. We filtered the next features with a big confidence bet score (to have less risk), and put 20 pounds on 3 different accumulators. [And it\u2019s gone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DT7bX-B1Mg)\\n\\nHope you had a good read.

It includes functionalities for discovering stocks, market sentiment analysis, fundamental and technical analysis, due diligence, prediction techniques, and more.\\n\\nThe open source code is available [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<div style={{borderTop: \'1px solid #0088CC\', margin: \'1.5em 0\'}} />\\n\\nIf you like stocks and are careful with the way you spend your money, (me saying it seems counter-intuitive given that I bought GME at the peak, I know) you know how much time goes into buying shares of a stock.\\n\\nYou need to: Find stocks that are somehow undervalued; Research on the company, and its competitors; Check that the financials are healthy; Look into different technical indicators; Investigate SEC fillings and Insider activity; Look up for next earnings date and analysts estimates; Estimate market\u2019s sentiment through Reddit, Twitter, Stocktwits; Read news;. \u2026 the list goes on.\\n\\nIt\u2019s tedious and I don\u2019t have 24k for a Bloomberg terminal. Which led me to the idea during xmas break to spend the time creating my own terminal. I introduce you to \u201cGamestonk Terminal\u201d (probably should\u2019ve sent 1 tweet everyday to Elon Musk for copyrights permission eheh).\\n\\nAs someone mentioned, this is meant to be like a swiss army knife for finance.\\n\\nIt contains the following functionalities:\\n\\n- **Discover Stocks**: Some features are: Top gainers; Sectors performance; upcoming earnings releases; top high shorted interest stocks; top stocks with low float; top orders on fidelity; and some SPAC websites with news/calendars.\\n\\n- **Market Sentiment**: Main features are: Scrolling through Reddit main posts, and most tickers mentions; Extracting trending symbols on stocktwits, or even stocktwit sentiment based on bull/bear flags; Twitter in-depth sentiment prediction using AI; Google mentions over time.\\n\\n- **Research Web pages**: List of good pages to do research on a stock, e.g. macroaxis, zacks, macrotrends, ..\\n\\n- **Fundamental Analysis**: Read financials from a company from Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Financial Modeling Prep API. Since I only rely on free data, I added the information from all of these, so that the user can get it from the source it trusts the most. Also exports management team behind stock, along with their pages on Google, to speed up research process.\\n\\n- **Technical Analysis**: The usual technical indicators: sma, rsi, macd, adx, bbands, and more.\\n\\n- **Due Diligence**: It has several features that I found to be really useful. Some of them are: Latest news of the company; Analyst prices and ratings; Price target from several analysts plot over time vs stock price; Insider activity, and these timestamps marked on the stock price historical data; Latest SEC fillings; Short interest over time; A check for financial warnings based on Sean Seah book.\\n\\n- **Prediction Techniques**: The one I had more fun with. It tries to predict the stock price, from simple models like sma and arima to complex neural network models, like LSTM. The additional capability here is that all of these are easy to configure. Either through command line arguments, or even in form of a configuration file to define your NN. It also allows backtesting.\\n\\n- **Reports**: Allows you to run several jobs functionalities and write daily notes on a stock, so that you can assess what you thought about the stock in the past, to perform better decisions.\\n\\n- **Comparison Analysis**: Allows to compare different stocks.\\n\\n- **On the ROADMAP**: Cryptocurrencies, Portfolio Analysis, Credit Analysis. Feel free to add the features you\u2019d like and we would happily work on it.\\n\\nThis project will always remain open-source, and the idea is that it can grow substantially over-time so that more and more people start taking advantage of it.\\n\\nFeel free to contribute towards the project.\\n\\nFeedback is extremely welcome!"}]}}')}}]);
