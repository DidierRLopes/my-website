Hey all,

Do any of you know what **Docker, Jupyter Lab integration, features website and new features** have in common? Well this is what has been happening in [Gamestonk Terminal](https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal) world since last month, and **MORE**!

### Docker

- This has been a highly requested feature from our more experienced dev users, as it allows you to run our code in a container, pull the image and then get going with a smooth installation process. You will also be able to run Jupyer Lab from our Docker container.

### Jupyter Lab Integration

- Jupyter is on course to take over the world (see [here](https://netflixtechblog.com/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233)).
- Big investment banks like JP Morgan use Jupyter too, see [this](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/jupyterlab_templates).
- Professionals in the industry such as Data Scientists, Data Analysts and Machine Learning engineers are familiar with the combo dockers+notebooks. Therefore, it makes our terminal an attractive Open-Source project to devote time to.
- Academia students and universities will be able to use terminal data through a notebook for their projects and coursework. We’re on track to be able to achieve something on this soon!

### Hugo Website

- Link [here](https://gamestonkterminal.github.io/GamestonkTerminal/).
- This will not only simplify a contributor’s documentation process, but it will also let non-Gamestonkers now see the vast number of features we offer and yes, when you read “offer” this is actually an offer since the tool is **completely free** to use.

### Main New features

- New Dark Pool Shorts menu
- Refactored and improved Crypto menu!!!
- Dark Pool and Crypto report generation
- Excel Discounted Cash Flow created by a MBA student
- Big code refactoring to allow for contributors to easily get started with our codebase
- Contributing document (click here).

### Tier 2 features
- [Sentiment Investor](https://sentimentinvestor.com/) data features implemented by the SI team themselves
- Feature/fraud indicators implemented by a MBA student
- Multiple plotting for economy data for more insight extraction
- Screener presets to not miss out on promising tickers
- Several new Technical Analysis indicators, e.g. Fibonacci, Fisher transform, Centre of gravity, zlma, Donchian channels…
- Unusual options activity
- Hot penny stocks in discovery menu
- A contributor implementation of a realtime earnings expected move, from [The Geek of Wallstreet](https://thegeekofwallstreet.com/2021/08/03/realtime-earnings-data/)
- Several new YahooFinance commands to discover promising tickers
- Refactor Exploratory Data Analysis and Residual Analysis menus into a Quantitative Analysis one

As if this wasn’t enough, we’re also working towards a [Discord bot](https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/DiscordBot) so you can make best use of our terminal when discussing trading strategies with your friends. This was an initiative from a contributor, which just goes to show how much **we rely on our community to drive our project**.
