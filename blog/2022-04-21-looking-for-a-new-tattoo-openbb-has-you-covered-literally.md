Exploring unconventional ways to increase brand visibility, OpenBB's co-founder gets a tattoo of the company logo. This blog post discusses the thought process behind this unique marketing strategy.

When [OpenBB Terminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal) started last year, I went from having your typical career as a Software Engineer to becoming a co-founder & CEO of a C-Corporation overnight. One thing that I've really learnt from this change, is I can no longer code for 12–16 hours a day straight as my role now involves so much more than this… and most interestingly, one of those things is marketing.

During Easter in Lisbon, I was thinking about how to increase the visability of [OpenBB](https://openbb.co/). _An investment research platform for everyone, anywhere_. Seems self-explanatory and something most of us would relate to, but the problem is reaching a bigger audience.

Due to [our $8.5M funding](https://openbb.co/blog/gme-didnt-take-me-to-the-moon-but-gamestonk-terminal-did) we have money in the bank, which means we can afford to do some ads campaigns. However, I very much dislike the traditional type of ads, whether that is with Google, Instagram, Twitter or YouTube. Particularly YouTube ones, when I see an ad there I immediately think less of the product being advertised due to how intrusive these are.

That's why I started thinking of ways to share our OpenBB brand in a non-intrusive way. In fact, I went one step further and started thinking when I personally would welcome ads.

Funnily enough, the first thing that came to my mind was when I go to the bathroom without my phone. Although there's no ads on the back of shampoos/shower gel/soap/spray, I would very much welcome them.

It's not like knowing the %s of ingredients that makes up cleaning products has a lot of use cases…

This brought me to the conclusion that I would only welcome ads if I was bored and didn't have anything keeping me "too busy". This immediately made me think of London underground ads (the most effective type of DOOH imho). I always read those ads. The main reason being that I don't have WiFi underground and the noise is too loud to listen to a podcast. Hence, I imagined the underground looking like:

When I checked for the prices, I was looking at a marketing campaign for a couple of days in a couple of stations costing over 5 digits, which is quite expensive for the short time-span.

Therefore, I started to think of cheaper alternatives that yielded a better ROI. The next thing that passed through my mind was wearing OpenBB swag (yet to be revealed, [subscribe to our newsletter](https://openbb.co/newsletter) to know more). However, I feel like nowadays everyone has a t-shirt with a different logo and these aren't as noticeable as before — at least that's my perspective.

This lead me to think: **What about a tattoo?** It's a similar concept than OpenBB clothes but more powerful. In addition, when wearing OpenBB clothes with a visible tattoo, this will create a "curiosity" effect since the symbol is repeated (clothes and tattoo). In addition, I've not come across anyone using their body to express their brand.

Later that day I booked a tattoo slot, paid 100 euros, and got the OpenBB logo on the back of my arm as shown below,

I will let you know on my socials how many people ask about this tattoo over the course of my life.

And if you like [our logo](https://www.openbb.design/9242dc28c/p/809a44-logo) and [our values](https://www.openbb.design/9242dc28c/p/91bbcc-our-values), OpenBB will pay you for the tattoo.

**One things for sure, now I can definitely put the gym membership as a company expense since I'm a walking billboard 😄**

The first walking/running/coding/eating/drinking OpenBB billboard.
