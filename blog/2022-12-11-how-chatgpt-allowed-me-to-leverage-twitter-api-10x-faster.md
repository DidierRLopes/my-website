Leveraging the power of ChatGPT to interact with Twitter API for real-time financial news updates.

For a while now, users have been asking for adding real-time financial news on [OpenBB Terminal](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal).

Since OpenBB Terminal is a command line interface for the world‚Äôs financial data, and there is no threading going on ‚Äî there was never a very straightforward way to do this.

**Until today.**

After recalling [this tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1591121142961799168?s=20&t=j-cjTu-XA9SNcY8PBrbUnQ) from Elon earlier in November, I realized that I‚Äôve been using Twitter for news substantially more than MSM.

So, my next train of thought was; What if I was able to somehow display the latest tweets from Twitter accounts that I trust. In particular, accounts that have up-to-date information and usually mention the words ‚ÄúJUST IN‚Äù or ‚ÄúBREAKING‚Äù. E.g. [@WatcherGuru](https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru) or [@unusual_whales](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales).

By doing this, I could then use the bottom of the OpenBB Terminal to highlight the news. An example of this is below:

## Coding and ChatGPT

The next step for me was to implement the code!

First, I needed to understand how I could have access to the last tweet of a specific user account. I already had a Twitter API account created, which meant I already had the key, token and secrets, therefore, I just needed to read documentation to understand how to use the Twitter API. Hence, I started reading [Twitter‚Äôs developer documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/api-reference/get-tweets-search-recent).

The day before I had been playing around with ChatGPT. And like everyone else, I was very impressed. One of the things that surprised me the most was how good it was at outputting working code with an explanation along the lines.

So, while I was reading the documentation, I was thinking ‚ÄúI wish there was a way for me to just be able to get the last N tweets of an account without needing to dig in the developer documentation‚Äù. Could ChatGPT be the answer?

So I tried‚Ä¶

This was already amazing. But I‚Äôm lazy and didn‚Äôt want to copy all the cells individually to put it into a Jupyter notebook, so asked ChatGPT to provide the code output as a single block. I wasn‚Äôt convinced it was going to work. **But it did**.

‚Ä¶ it just worked. ü§Ø

After that, I needed the timestamp associated with the tweet, to see how old it was. As usual, I started looking into [Tweepy documentation](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/authentication.html#twitter-api-v2).

**Ups, what was I doing again?**

After a couple of seconds, I went onto ChatGPT and asked how I could get the timestamp of a tweet using Tweepy library.

**And ü™Ñ, it worked again!!!**

One thing that is for sure: ChatGPT is going to truly disrupt many industries. And I will be here for it.

PS: The PR with this addition is in development [here](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/pull/3757).
