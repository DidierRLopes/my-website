Two years of OpenBB: A look back at our achievements and growth in the world of open-source finance.

Today is OpenBB 2 years anniversary of our incorporation. So it’s important to look back and understand the magnitude of what we achieved in 24 months.

In that time we’ve had:

- 100k+ downloads of our installer since we started tracking it
- 2.5M bot commands have been run on Discord and Telegram from over 40k users
- GitHub project grew from 8k stars to 23k+, becoming #1 open source project in the topic of finance
- Our Discord group grew from 1k users to 13k+
- Our SDK has been pip installed over 25k times
- Our team grew from 3 to 19 around the globe
- For more, see http://openbb.co/open

But where were we 2 years ago?

- Only Gamestonk Terminal, the name OpenBB only appeared when we came out of stealth mode in March 2022
- No OpenBB Hub (only launched in May 2023)
- No OpenBB SDK (only launched in Dec 2022)
- No OpenBB Bot (only launched in July 2022)
- No Terminal Pro or Excel Add-In early alpha (development started in 2023)
- No SDK v4 which allows community and data providers to build their own data connectors, easily (to be announced soon)
- No community routines — our first feature aimed at community with upvoting and sharing of routines
- No open source PyWry — A web-view rendering library in python we open source in Feb 2023
- No OpenBB Champions — Our way to highlight users that do impressive work on top of our ecosystem
- No partnerships with universities, financial societies or investment clubs
- No partnerships with data vendors — now we have close relationships with most vendors you would know

If we only focus on where Gamestonk Terminal was 2 years ago we had:

- Static charts using matplotlib (Interactive ones using PyWry was launched in May 2023)
- No way for users to run routines from other users from the terminal directly (launched 3 days ago)
- No AskOBB feature with LlamaIndex (launched in June 2023)
- No way for users to customise the terminal, select default data sources and set their API keys — all from the Hub
- No way to double click an installer and get started in a few minutes — hassle free
- The documentation on markdown files across the repository, today people often praise our documentation in conversations
- No AI features, no reports menu, no dashboards menu, no fixed income, no futures, …
- And the OpenBB Terminal charts looked like this

Bill Gates said the famous saying:

> People overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in 10 years.

<br />

In fast-paced startups, I think a better sentence would be, “People overestimate what they can do in one week and underestimate what they can do in 1 year”.

Looking forward to continue building the future of investment research, we’re just getting started.

PS: On a personal level within those 2 years: I quit my full-time job to build OpenBB, got 2 dogs, got married and moved to the Bay Area. Life is great ❤️
