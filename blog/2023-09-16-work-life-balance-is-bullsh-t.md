This blog post challenges the concept of work-life balance, arguing that success often requires sacrifices in personal time and relationships. It suggests that true balance comes from finding joy in your work and surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals.

For successful individuals, achieving a work-life balance is a luxury often associated with those born into wealth.

Let me explain.

There must be a clear inverse correlation between success (let's say measured by wealth) and the size of your circle of friends.

**If you want to be at the top of a field, you must work hard.**

End.

Regardless of what BS people say about work-life balance.

You may be lucky — right place right time kind of thing. But by default, you need to work hard to expand your luck's surface.

And that means that you need to spend your personal time working harder, to be above average.

Since time is limited you need to sacrifice time spent outside working hours, otherwise you will only be average.

People will soon realize that in order to optimize for a successful career, cutting time spent with friends is a necessary evil.

Plus, as you become older you'll prioritize physical health (which impacts your longevity + performance) and your relationship with your partner (which provides the most significant ROI in terms of happiness).

So, I suggest 2 things:

- Work on a problem and in a space that you truly enjoy so you don't consider it work
- Build with people who share the same values as you so you consider them friends Once that happens, work-life balance means nothing.

What's your take?
