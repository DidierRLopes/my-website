How I'm using Docusaurus to build my own personal website.

One of my goals for 2023 was to learn web development. Given that I knew 0 to nothing last year, I am extremely happy with my progress.

I never had the time to fully dedicate to it in terms of doing a program/course — but as with anything in life, the best way to learn is by doing.

And this year I worked on web development for:

* OpenBB Hub — https://my.openbb.co
* OpenBB marketing website — https://openbb.co
* OpenBB docs — https://docs.openbb.co
* OpenBB Terminal Pro — https://pro.openbb.co

Thank you José Donato for always helping me with anything!

In addition, I’ve always wanted to have my own personal website. So I felt that this would be the perfect opportunity to do so as I could spend some time with it over weekends.

And so I did, and open source here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/personal-website

However, this website was taking too much of my spare time, which I could use for more important work. And at the time I became very familiar with Docusaurus, which is what we use for OpenBB docs.

So I thought — why not just use Docusaurus to make my personal website? It’s easy to edit, I’m already very familiar with the architecture, and it’s very easy to update when there’s new information.

So that’s what I did, and also made the entire code open source here: https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website

You can access the full website here — https://didierlopes.com/, and there you can find: my personal projects, books I’ve read or want to read, interviews/webinars/podcasts, resume or even my blog.

Any feedback is welcome.
