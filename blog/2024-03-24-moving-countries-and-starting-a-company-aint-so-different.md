I have started a company. I have moved countries. It turns out that there's a lot in common between these.

Recently, I wrote a blogpost about the [difference in culture between London and San Francisco](/blog/moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed). I convinced my wife and dogs, packed our bags, and didn't look back. After all, I would live in the city with the highest density of builders per capita.

**But why?**

Most of my friends and family didn't understand why I would leave London. I liked the city, I enjoyed my lifestyle, I had friends, I played football with the same group every week, had dinner at the same restaurants, was close to family, and wouldn't be able to save money.

Logically speaking, this move didn't make any sense. No one really told me that I was doing the right thing, but internally, I knew I had to.

I believe this isn't so different from creating a startup. This blog post will explain what they have in common and why I did it.

## Creating a startup / Deciding to leave your country

[Elad Gil](http://eladgil.com/) wrote a really good [article](https://blog.eladgil.com/p/startups-are-an-act-of-desperation) on how creating a startup is an act of desperation. I believe that post could be equally applicable to moving countries, so I will list the same points used by Elad in the context of moving countries and provide examples. Most of the time, the person moving countries has a mix of the below bullet points.

> **Career desperation.** Startups allow people early or stuck in their careers to jump a few steps ahead.

<br />

This applies equally to moving, and is why I left Portugal to pursue an MSc at Imperial College London.

> **Financial desperation.** If successful, a startup will also leapfrog you financially.

<br />

This is the biggest motivation for people to move countries. This is why I was born in Switzerland, even though my parents are Portuguese. Having blue-collar jobs, they emigrated to a country with a better economy to provide my brother and me with a better life.

> **Product or mission desperation.** The other reason startups often exist is that the founders are desperate for a product to exist in the world.

<br />

In this case, it's the equivalent of hearing about Silicon Valley in documentaries or watching Steve Jobs presenting the iPhone in 2007. You cannot ignore that as an engineer, so you are desperate to move to be part of that tech scene.

> **Desperation to do something big or important, and to avoid wasted time.** Some people want to "make a dent in the universe" and are motivated by doing something useful with their lives.

<br />

This is what the "American dream" is all about. People moved to the US to do something bigger than themselves and achieve the promised dream.

> **Revenge vs the Arena**

<br />

The equivalent to this is when someone returns to their home country after several years outside with more wealth and/or experience.

## Growing a startup / Living abroad

### Mission and Vision

When creating a company, you must have a clear mission and vision. This allows you to create a community/team that will be with you for the long run. Similarly, when moving countries, it's essential to have a well-defined goal. This doesn't mean that the goal cannot change; after all, companies pivot. However, you need to have a strategy that you follow until you don't.

### Risk and Uncertainty

Startups and moving to a new country both involve stepping into the unknown. Entrepreneurs often take financial and personal risks, while those moving countries leave behind familiar surroundings, support systems, and sometimes even their careers. Uncertainty becomes a constant companion, demanding adaptability, problem-solving skills, and the ability to embrace change with open arms.

### Cultural Integration and Networking

Building a successful startup requires networking, forming strategic partnerships, and understanding the market. Similarly, when moving countries, one must navigate cultural differences, learn new languages, and establish a network of contacts. Expanding social circles, building relationships, and immersing oneself in the local culture contribute to personal growth and enhance professional opportunities, just like in the startup world.

### Resilience and Persistence

Building a startup and moving countries demands unwavering resilience and persistence in facing challenges. Startups encounter setbacks, pivots, and failures, but successful entrepreneurs persist and learn from their experiences. Similarly, moving countries can bring unexpected hurdles, such as language barriers, difficulties making friends, challenges adapting to a new culture, or not finding a routine. Embracing these challenges with determination and adaptability paves the way for growth and achievement.

### Learning and Growth

Startups and moving countries are transformative experiences that offer immense personal and professional growth opportunities. Entrepreneurs continuously learn from their successes and failures in the startup world, refining their strategies and acquiring new skills. Likewise, moving countries provides a unique chance to learn about different cultures, broaden perspectives, and develop resilience, patience, and empathy. Both experiences foster personal development and shape individuals into more well-rounded and adaptable individuals.

## Why did I do it?

The reason why I started OpenBB and also moved country is a combination of 2 factors:

### Product or mission desperation.

On a startup level, I have experienced the need for an open-source investment research platform. That's why I wanted to create this platform, which was yet to exist. I think it wouldn't be possible if I didn't dedicate my time to it. This is why OpenBB's success is so important-it will enable millions of investors to have better access to data and better understand the financial market.

Growing up as an engineer fascinated by tech and innovation, the US has always been home to the biggest companies and hottest products. I've always been attracted to Silicon Valley, but before OpenBB, I never had the chance to. The first job I applied to after finishing university was Waymo in CA, but they didn't sponsor VISAs for that role.

### Desperation to do something big or important. 

On a startup level, I want to work on something bigger than myself. I want to solve a problem that no one has solved before and build something useful for millions of people that can withstand time.

I will do whatever it takes to build the first truly open-source investment research platform. Moving to SF increased my network opportunities with other entrepreneurs and builders from whom I can learn. I want to be fully immersed in this ecosystem and give it my all to do everything possible to help OpenBB succeed as a company, regardless of the outcome.

Note: A few weeks ago, I moved to NYC because I truly believe living here would increase the chances of OpenBB's success compared to living in SF.
