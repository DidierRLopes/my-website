My friend Matt, from VanEck, built a backend with data from Coingecko, Velodata, Artemis, CCdata, Glassnode, MSTR Tracker, Telegram and Google - all in OpenBB.

[Matt Maximo](https://x.com/mattmaximo1) has been building a backend with data from Coingecko, Velodata, Artemis, CCdata, Glassnode, MSTR Tracker, Telegram and Google.

However, he didn't find the best product where he could:

1. Bring all this data into one interface
2. Leverage an intelligence layer on top
3. Collaborate with his team on it

<br />

Until he did.

With our free tier - Matt was able to single-handedly create almost 50 different data widgets that he (and his team) will be able to access seamlessly on OpenBB.

As we shift to firms being more in control of their data, and with the clear gains from having an additional intelligence layer on top of that data - the need for OpenBB in the market has never been clearer.

Shifting the control back to financial firms.

More open. More adaptable.

If you want help on connecting your own backend (crypto or other) to OpenBB - reach out to myself and team.
