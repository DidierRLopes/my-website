This is how OpenBB is reaching users worldwide with Chrome's translation features, making financial analytics accessible in multiple languages and expanding our presence across 84% of countries since launch.

Since our launch on October 7th, we realized that while the majority of our audience is based in the US - we have users utilizing OpenBB from all around the globe.

In fact, if we count sign ups since October we have a 84% country representation.

Today, most of the top financial firms have reached out to OpenBB to learn more. Either because they heard about us from others, or had someone internally speaking about OpenBB.

However - it has also happened having conversation with firms that focus so much on emerging markets (e.g. LatAm) that they speak mostly Portuguese or Spanish.

So, here I am showing you that you can utilize the Google Translate feature that comes with Google Chrome in under 10 seconds to have our product being translated in real-time to your language of choice.

I've been playing with it in Portuguese, and it works *surprisingly* well.

This even means that you can utilize your AI copilot in your language of choice, which is mind blowing!

It's this Christmas that I will be able to convert my family to DAU. ðŸ˜ƒ
