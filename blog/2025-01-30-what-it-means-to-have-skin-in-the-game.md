From getting the OpenBB logo tattooed to honoring a promise of a Bali trip, this is a personal reflection on what it truly means to have "skin in the game". It's not about reckless commitment, but about standing fully behind your words and actions - a principle that's shaped both my personal life and my approach to building OpenBB.

I just finished reading Nassim Taleb's "Skin in the Game," and it hit home in a big way. (PS: you can find more books that I've read over the years <a href="/books/already-read" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).

The idea of having real stakes in your decisions isn't new to me – it's something I've lived by for as long as I can remember. Taleb's writing puts it into words beautifully, but for me, this has always been a way of life.

I believe in going all-in on what matters. In fact, I'm so committed to this philosophy that I have OpenBB logo tattooed on my body.

It's not about showing off or trying to prove something. It's a reminder that when I'm in, I'm all the way in. No half measures, no excuses. This isn't about taking wild risks for the sake of it – it's about standing behind what you believe in, fully and without hesitation.

This mindset started when I was young, mostly from my dad.

I learned that our word has to mean something. Promises weren't just things I would say, they were real commitments that I always followed through.

I remember when we were kids I told one of my friends jokingly "if you do x, I will give you 2 euros" and he did it and we laughed. The day after I brought him 2 euros to school and he had forgotten about it.

More recently, I promised my friends that if the open source project I had started (Gamestonk Terminal) ever became a company, I'd cover a two-week stay accommodation in Bali. When <a href="https://openbb.co/blog/gme-didnt-take-me-to-the-moon-but-gamestonk-terminal-did" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenBB raised money</a>, I let them know and we booked that trip for the following year.

That wasn't just talk. It was a real promise, tied to real accountability.

The way I see it, taking risks and owning the results – good or bad – is what separates people who truly stand for something from those who just talk about it. When you're all in, you can't hide. If things go wrong, you take the hit. If they go right, you've earned it. Either way, you're accountable.

This idea of skin in the game just makes so much sense to me, why wouldn't you?

It's about showing up fully in everything you do, whether it's work, relationships, or personal goals. And it's about being honest with yourself and others when things don't go as planned.

Trust is built by following through, especially when it's hard. When people know you'll keep your word, even when it's inconvenient, you build something way more valuable than a quick win: you build real trust. And that trust isn't just given; it's earned through consistency and integrity.

These days, it feels like too many people are afraid to commit. They hedge their bets, avoid risks, and try to keep their options open. But I've found that being all-in – really having skin in the game – is the best way to live life.

You can also see this by the fact that I am pretty much an open book - either sharing what I'm thinking through blogs like this or sharing all my code on GitHub.

For the better, or the worst.
