How I built a custom OpenBB widget to save my friend hours of manual work on his newsletter with 190,000+ subscribers.

The open source code is available [here](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/opening-bell-daily-openbb).

<!-- truncate -->

<div style={{borderTop: '1px solid #0088CC', margin: '1.5em 0'}} />

Last weekend I spoke with my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philrosen/" target="_blank">Phil Rosen</a>.

He used to work as a Senior Markets Reporter at Business Insider.

And left to start his own news and research outlet: <a href="https://www.openingbelldailynews.com/" target="_blank">Opening Bell Daily</a>, just over 1 year ago.

He's been sharing a newsletter everyday since and has crossed over 190,000 subscribers!!!

Funnily enough, we commented on how we were speaking on a Saturday morning and the weekends are the times where we are the most productive.

As I was sharing more of OpenBB and how he can utilize it for the content in his newsletter, he shared a table chart that he crafts manually to his audience, which always takes him a significant amount of time to do every single day.

Well, I wouldn't be an engineer by training if I didn't solve this for him.

<div className="flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto">
    <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hQtFL_0NjU?si=oUC-X0XsnKad-V9E"
        width="1000"
        height="500"
    />
</div>

More than that - to celebrate 1 year of Opening Bell Daily: 

> Any OpenBB user can add this URL as a custom backend application on OpenBB and have Phil's market snapshot on their screen every day. https://openbb-opening-bell-daily.fly.dev

<br />

Or you can also sign up to Phil's newsletter and get it in your inbox along with insightful content, every day!

PS: I have made this code [open source](https://github.com/DidierRLopes/opening-bell-daily-openbb) so others can create their own widgets for OpenBB or get inspired.
