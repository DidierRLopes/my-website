How AI is evolving from reactive to proactive in financial services, and why this shift will transform how investors discover opportunities and generate alpha.

<!-- truncate -->

<div style={{borderTop: '1px solid #0088CC', margin: '1.5em 0'}} />

This week I was asked the question "Where is OpenBB with AI next year?".

Our play here is clear, we are the Enterprise UI that lives between data and AI.

So when someone asks this question, they are ultimately asking "What will be possible to do on OpenBB as models get better and cheaper".

And I think that it all comes down to: Reactive VS Proactive

Today, LLMs/agents/AI is reactive for the most part.

It requires users to have a clear intent on what they want the LLM to do, they are required to be prompted (pun intended).

However, what happens when models get better and cheaper and they have an interface that has access to all their data in one place?

Simple.

It can scan the data every few seconds and generate investment ideas, find alpha and truly act like a partner.

More importantly, as the agent starts to engage with the user, we will be able to provide feedback to the model: "this wasn't a good idea because of X", "semi-conductors are not part of my mandate", ... and these models will adapt to become more personalized.

The exciting thing?

We aren't that far off from this being a reality.

This is how I envision the future:
