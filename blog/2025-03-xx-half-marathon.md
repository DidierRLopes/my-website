## Background

- Haymakers for Hope link
- Why

## Fundraising

- There's a lot of people trying to attend the race, there were close to 30k people this year
- However, it's not a matter of just signing up, you need to apply for an organization that has "bibs" for the race
- In the event you get accepted - you will have to raise money to the cause
- I personally love this as everyone on the race day has raised money to institutions that they care about, and so it has more meaning
- What I did to prepare myself for the fundraise

## Preparing - Paperwork

- Sign up to NYRR - when you sign up, be careful about your time estimation! They use that to select in which wave you go. I had put 2h bc it was my first half marathon and I had no idea how much I would run, but I should have put 1h30m instead - this way I would have gone with people that have faster pace and be less blocked at the start! (more on that later)
- Pay the race fee
- Sign up for the bib pick up
- The pickup location was actually pretty cool with lots of merchandise for the race. They also had all the names of the runners on the wall

## How I Prepared - Physically

- I didn't do as much as I should have admittedly - but because I do boxing 2-3 per week and it's very intense I wasn't too concerned about being able to make it
- However, I still wanted to make sure that I could finish it so 1 month before I run a half marathon in 2h, just to know I could do it. Then it would be a matter of doing a better time
- A week before I also run 12 miles with a bit more elevation in Central Park, as when I did the half marathon the terrain was fully plain

## On the Day - Before Race

- I ate 3 eggs and one banana
- I wore t-shirt, shoes, no-grip socks, airpods and should have brought my Apple watch but forgot
- I took an extra old sweater for before the race as it was cold, and we were told that you can give them away and the clothes go to charity. So, this was awesome
- Just before the race started I ate one of those gels to keep you refreshed

## On the Day - Race

- As you start, your bib is tagged so they get the exact time you cross the start line. So don't worry too much about not being at the front of your "wave"
- However, this kinda becomes an issue later as you will have all these runners on front of you and is very hard to overcome
- During the race there are a lot of stations with water and gatorade. So I don't recommend you to take your own bottle of water
- The hills can be tough, particularly when you are 7/8 miles in. I definitely saw a lot of people stop running then - I think you need to keep pulling through here as they don't last that long and breaking your rythm is only going to make things harder
- Running through Brooklyn Bridge (first time it ever happened) and then Times Square was awesome!!! The bridge because it's a beautiful bridge and Times Square because of the energy of everyone cheering on the runners. I saw some very funny cardboards, including:
  - Pain is temporary, Strava is 4eva
  - Your outie is running a half marathon
  - "If you slow down I'll drop this" - someone that was naked and had the cardboard covering their intimate parts ahah
  - "When you need to actually run the race you signed up for" - with the face of someone screaming
  - From 1 to 10, you are a 13
  - Run now, beer later
  - You are only running this race because you are 0.5 crazy
  - People wearing dinosaur costumes or having a cardboard with "Power Up"
- Mid race they were giving runners a gel - I didn't take theirs and used mine instead as I knew my body was used to these and didn't want to try something new. I took mine around mile 9
- Although I left my watch at home I had a rough idea of my time because I knew at what time I passed the start line, so at the end I increased slightly the pace to do 1:45 which is what I was aiming at. I'd recommend to try to conserve your last explosion to the end so you know better when to deploy it - particularly because it is likely that the path you are taking is a complete new one
- My parents and wife were waiting for me at the end which was awesome

## On the Day - After Race

- After you cross the finish line, everyone is cheering you. They will immediately give you a pack that consists of water, gatorade, cereal bar, pretzels and apple
- As you keep walking you also get your medal - which is pretty cool!
- And finally, you get one of those covers to put over your shoulders which was nice as it was a bit cold

All in all, it was an awesome experience.

Although running is not one of my favorite activities, it was good to know that I can do a half marathon.

Next, I'm signing up for a full marathon :)
