OpenBB isn't just software - it's foundational infrastructure that lets firms shape their own financial workspace, moving beyond one-size-fits-all solutions toward modularity and extensibility.

Something I’ve noticed lately, many people I speak with who do know about OpenBB say the same thing, almost verbatim:

- "You guys are so underrated."

- "I was in a room with CIOs and they hadn’t yet heard about OpenBB."

- "I wonder why more people don’t use OpenBB."

<br />

They say it with a mix of **surprise and respect** - because once they’ve seen it in action, they get it.

New products take time. New ideas, especially in finance, take even longer. The industry doesn't exactly sprint towards innovation.

But we’re not waiting for permission.

We are quietly redefining what a modern financial infrastructure looks like.

It’s not about making a nicer desktop app. It’s not about putting a glossy skin on legacy workflows. We’re not trying to mimic old tools - we’re playing our own game. Executing on our own vision.

**OpenBB is foundational.**

We built it from scratch because we had no choice. Nothing existed that let us move fast, integrate deeply, and give real control to the end user. So we built it. And in doing so, we gave firms the ability to do the same.

**OpenBB isn’t just software**. It’s infrastructure. It’s a flexible, programmable foundation that lets firms **shape their own financial workspace** - aligned with their needs, integrated with their tools, and adaptable as they evolve.

That’s where we fit.

And now, with the launch of apps, users are even closer to value. Apps cut through noise. They bring workflows into focus. They get insights into hands faster. This isn’t about flashy features - it’s about practical, daily utility that compounds.

OpenBB meets users wherever they are. We empower individuals to work smarter and faster. We enable researchers to glide from raw data to actionable insight. And we give firms the building blocks to create infrastructure that reflects how they think, how they work - not how outdated systems expect them to conform.

_The Terminalist_ captured this perfectly in their <a href="https://theterminalist.substack.com?utm_source=navbar&utm_medium=web" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">latest post</a>:

What other company fits this description better than us?

We aren’t clinging to old paradigms. We are betting on modularity, composability, and extensibility - the principles that will define the next generation of fintech.

The Terminalist calls it the rise of post-terminalism.

We see it as **the fall of the illusion that one-size-fits-all**.

People don’t always appreciate what we’ve built - until they do. And when they see it - when they feel the control, the extensibility, the raw power, it’s hard to go back.

The infrastructure is already here.
