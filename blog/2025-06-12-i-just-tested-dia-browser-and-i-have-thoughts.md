Thoughts on Dia browser's AI integration, exploring its similarities with OpenBB Workspace and the role of AI assistants in finance tools.

So I just tested the Dia browser (available today for Arc users).

I actually like the idea.

This is actually similar to the insight we had when we started incorporating AI natively to the OpenBB Workspace - that chatting interface is a path for human interact.

But often it isn't.

Often you want the human in the driving seat, and an AI assistant right there.

It's about the context this AI assistant has access to and what it can do.

It's about having AI having access to the same tools that you have, and allowing you to streamline your workflows.

When putting OpenBB Workspace next to Dia it's easy to understand that the concept is similar.

</p>

The main difference, for me, is that our workspace provides a more tight-loop control over your data and interactions. Whereas Dia has a more open nature.

This is a feature, not a bug. We want the AI agent to focus on data that firms want to give their users access to, and often that means that not all data is fair game.

One of the things that I wish they would do (as a current Arc user) is bring the left sidebar back.

</p>

In a way, how we structure the workspace - which was actually inspired by Arc :)

We've come full circle on this one.

## Slight note update

Although I like the browser, I haven't adopted it yet.

Why?

Well Peer said it perfectly [here](https://x.com/peer_rich/status/1936419182423281699).

It's about whether the company is still around in 1 year or not. Particularly as they are over 100 people and still hiring - without a proven business model, AFAIK?

The irony here is that - had they open source Arc, then I would have trust them to use Dia because if the company ceased to exist, someone would be able to take over the project.
