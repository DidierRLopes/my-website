AI is flattening knowledge gaps. Adaptability is rising in value - but true mastery still matters.

## The modern workplace is built for generalists

In small teams, especially startups, specialization is a luxury.

Marketers write copy but also wireframe landing pages. Engineers switch between backend, frontend, and even customer support. Operations folks may spend Monday managing payroll and Tuesday debugging a webhook issue.

This isn’t disorganization - it’s a reflection of lean teams solving wide problems fast.


## AI supercharges the generalist

Generative AI has changed the cost of learning and execution:

- A PM with no SQL experience can analyze database queries with an AI copilot.

- A designer unfamiliar with frontend code can generate working React prototypes.

- A founder without legal training can draft and refine contracts in minutes.

<br />

What used to require a course, a consultant, or a specialist now takes curiosity and a good prompt.

The result? Generalists can confidently swim into previously specialist-only waters.


## Specialists still matter, but the bar has risen

This doesn’t mean specialists are obsolete. Far from it.

But today, being a specialist means something deeper:

**It means pursuing a level of depth and nuance so great that AI models struggle to replicate it.**

Think of it like pursuing a PhD. Not in the academic sense, but in the intensity of commitment.

A specialist in:

- Compiler optimization might spend years mastering edge-case memory management.
- Supply chain logistics may deeply understand geopolitical risk modeling.
- AI safety may dedicate their career to interpretability research at a token-level.

<br />

This isn’t _"I’ve used this tool for five years"_. It’s _"I know how to break it, fix it, and explain why it’s broken better than any model"_.

And for companies, these specialists still hold strategic value - especially when AI isn’t enough.

This is also why I believe that great developers aren’t going anywhere.

I am able to be extremely productive with Claude Code and can get code in a good stage to be reviewed by the team. But it cannot be merged as is, it always needs to be reviewed by our team who has been working on the same codebase for 3+ years and knows in and out of our product and how new features will impact it.

Depth matters.

## We’re moving toward a bifurcated future

As AI reshapes workflows, we’re seeing a structural split:

- **Generalists**: empowered by AI, fast-moving, versatile, multi-disciplinary.

- **Specialists**: narrowly focused, deeply committed, and uniquely human in their judgment.

<br />

AI collapses the middle. If you're "somewhat good" at something, AI might replace that edge.

But if you’re able to pivot across disciplines, AI makes you dangerous.

And if you are exceptionally deep in your domain, AI becomes your assistant - not your competition.

I’m excited to see how these generalist/specialist type of roles evolve.
