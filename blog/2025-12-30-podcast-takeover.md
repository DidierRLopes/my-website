A list of my favorite podcasts from 2025.

<!-- truncate -->

For the last couple of years I've been reading more and more books...

<p align="center">
    <img width="800" src="/blog/2025-12-30-podcast-takeover_1.png" alt="Books tracking screenshot" />
</p>

I keep track of my books read (and to read) in my website [here](/books/already-read).

Recently though, I've spent a great deal of time listening to podcasts.

I used to say I preferred books because they take months to produce, and by the time someone recommends one to me, there are thousands of reviews on it. So in a way, a book is not only carefully reviewed by the publisher but also vetted by thousands of readers.

Another thing: most books I read, startup stories, founder biographies, culture, ways of living, are timeless. If I read them today or in 10 years, they're just as valuable. This is a feature. It's also why authors spend so much time writing them in the first place. They know the ideas will echo for years to come.

Podcasts, on the other hand, are a thing of the moment. Hosts don't think as heavily about what they say, at least not to the extent authors do with a book.

But with that comes a more unfiltered glimpse of personality. You also get nuggets of wisdom that are actually relevant *right now*, since most podcasts I listen to are about the current state of the world.

Think of it as a simple 2x2: Is the topic timeless or timely? Has it already been deeply examined, or is it still unfolding? Books win for the former. Podcasts win for the latter.

So there are merits in both, and as a result I've been enjoying spending a lot of time in podcasts.

With that said, I've listened to over 20 different podcasts and while I don't religiously consume one in particular (ok, I do that with Acquired) - I tend to see them based on the episodes that get more traction on social media and my mood tbh.

Here's my list of favorites (and a recommended episode on each), with some organization:

## 1. Strategy, Business Models & Markets

Company breakdowns, investing frameworks, market structure.

### Acquired

Long-form, documentary-style deep dives into iconic companies and business stories. Ben and David do real research, real narrative, and episodes that feel like MBA case studies but actually interesting.

    />
</div>

<br />

### Founders

David Senra reads biographies of history's greatest founders and distills the lessons, patterns, and psychology behind how they built. It's basically getting the highlights of 50+ years of experience from people who've done impossible things - compressed into an episode you can listen to on a walk.

<br />

### Invest Like the Best

Patrick O'Shaughnessy interviews world-class investors across hedge funds, quants, PE, and more. Pure frameworks and mental models - no filler, no motivational fluff.

    />
</div>

<br />

### In Good Company

Hosted by Nicolai Tangen, CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund (the largest investor on earth). Surprisingly candid conversations with practitioners from the financial world who almost never do long interviews.

    />
</div>

<br />

### Jordi Visser

Jordi Visser (ex-CIO of Weiss Multi-Strategy) runs one of the few market podcasts that actually talks about the current markets. He blends macro, data, sentiment, and real trading intuition in a way that's easy to follow but still useful if you're deep in markets. Extremely high signal. And he uses OpenBB.

    />
</div>

<br />

## 2. AI-Focused

Deep AI conversations: safety, scaling laws, model design, applied AI strategy.

### Dwarkesh Patel

Dwarkesh is one of the clearest, most rigorous thinkers in AI today, and he interviews people operating at the absolute frontier. His conversations aren't surface-level - they cut into alignment, frontier model design, geopolitics, scientific breakthroughs, and the real engineering that actually moves the field forward.

</div>

<br />

### No Priors

Sarah Guo and Elad Gil talk to AI founders, researchers, and investors about the realities of building and scaling AI-native products. Practical, technical, and grounded.

    />
</div>

<br />

### Every

A media outfit led by Dan Shipper (co-founder & CEO of Every). Every publishes a daily newsletter and runs the podcast AI & I, where Dan has in-depth conversations with builders, creators, and thinkers about how they use AI and tools to build, create, and organize. Worth tuning in for unfiltered takes on the future of work, AI culture, and creator workflows.

### The Hedgineer Podcast

Hosted by Michael Watson - former Citadel MD turned engineer-interpreter of markets and tech. The show dives into how hedge funds, prop-trading shops, and modern asset managers build with data, AI, and engineering - recent episodes explore alt-data, ML-driven research, and trading-infra design. Great if you want the engineering + quant lens on finance.

## 3. Technology & Engineering

Software engineering, infrastructure, dev culture, technical founders.

### Bg2 Pod

Hosted by Brad Gerstner (founder & CEO of Altimeter) and Bill Gurley (legendary former Benchmark GP), BG2 is an "open-source" bi-weekly conversation on tech, markets, investing, and capitalism - basically two top-tier public markets/VC minds thinking out loud about how the world is changing.

</div>

<br />

### YCombinator

Run by YC partners, this is YC pulling back the curtain: founder interviews, office hours, and very blunt advice on building, launching, and scaling startups. It's basically YC's playbook, but in audio form.

### Uncapped with Jack Altman

</div>

<br />

### Lenny's Podcast

While often positioned as a product/PM podcast, in 2025 Lenny has become a must-listen for builders. He's become the voice of fast-growing startups in my opinion.

<br />

### Cheeky Pint

Hosted by John Collison (co-founder of Stripe), Cheeky Pint is basically "over a beer with builders and founders" - honest, wide-ranging, and often unexpectedly insightful. He sits down with people shaping tech, markets, and infrastructure and gets them to speak plainly about their work and worldview.

<br />

### Starter Story

Founded by Pat Walls, Starter Story digs into how real-life entrepreneurs built their businesses from scratch - from niche SaaS to e-commerce. It's a no-fluff breakdown of what worked, what didn't, and exactly how people went from zero to a working business.

<br />

## 5. Cultural & Intellectual Conversation

Curiosity-driven conversations with thinkers, scientists, creators.

### Lex Fridman Podcast

Lex runs long-form conversations with people who are actually interesting. A few hours of open space where he lets the guest think out loud - CEOs, politicians, scientists, founders, whoever. The big episodes get all the views, but the best ones are the niche conversations where someone brilliant has room to explain how they see the world.

I compiled this collection in an open source repo, so I can keep expanding as I listen to different ones. But also their RSS feeds so you can add them to your RSS readers if interested.
