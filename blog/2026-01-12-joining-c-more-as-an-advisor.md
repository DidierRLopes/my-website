I dedicate all my time to OpenBB. But when Carolina and Oscar showed me what they were building at [C-MORE](https://cmore-sustainability.com/) - verified ESG data meets AI - and we started collaborating informally, formalizing it as an advisor role was the obvious next step.

## Background

I've been hands-on with AI and machine learning since 2016, when I first applied Neural Networks to control systems in university. Since then, I've stayed close to the intersection of data, AI, and finance - implementing LSTM networks for financial time series forecasting ([open-sourced here](/blog/an-unusual-journey-learning-about-nns-for-a-phd-thesis)), and more recently fine-tuning small language models running locally ([detailed here](/blog/fine-tuning-a-llm-on-my-blog-posts)).

At OpenBB, we've built an AI agent that helps analysts interact with any data in the workspace. I've learned firsthand what it takes to make AI systems trustworthy: clean data, traceable reasoning, and evidence-based outputs.

Last year, I met Carolina and Oscar from C-MORE. Carolina is pursuing a PhD in Sustainability, Oscar brings deep Corporate Finance experience, and together they weren't just running a profitable, fast-growing company - they were getting their hands dirty with AI to out-innovate their competition.

We connected immediately. We're from Portugal and Spain, share similar values about building, and think long-term. And Carina, their co-founder, is actually from my hometown in Portugal (my quarterly reminder of how small the world is).

We started collaborating informally. We held discussions regarding approaches for parsing complex documents with Gemini's long-context models. We talked through their AI strategy. The conversations kept getting deeper.

Eventually, they asked to formalize the relationship. For me, it was a no-brainer - we were already working together, just without the paperwork.

## Why C-MORE

C-MORE is building one of the most advanced platforms in the world for operational risk and sustainability management.

They automate ESG data collection, cleaning, and analysis - transforming how companies understand and improve their environmental and social performance. Their software is already trusted by 100+ clients across finance, real estate, energy, and supply chain management.

But here's what matters: their data is verified by SGS, ensuring audit-ready quality. In a space where data integrity is everything, this is a massive differentiator.

C-MORE's mission is to use automation and intelligence to create a more efficient, transparent, and sustainable future. And I'm a believer in the team executing on it.

## Strong foundation

If there's one thing I've learned building AI systems, it's this: data is everything. Specifically, data that's clean, structured, and verified - exactly what C-MORE has spent years building.

Their data pipelines and collection processes are second to none. Over the past months, I've been helping the team think through their AI strategy - shaping how they approach evidence-based, traceable ESG answers.

## Why now

The timing couldn't be better.

Regulatory frameworks like CSRD, CSDDD, and the EU Taxonomy are making ESG transparency mandatory. Investors are demanding verifiable data. Companies are under pressure to prove, not just promise, their impact, and to do so without exposing themselves to financial or reputational risk.

Most ESG and operational-risk workflows today remain manual, fragmented, and costly - trapped in spreadsheets and endless verification loops.

C-MORE changes that.

Their platform doesn't just automate ESG reporting; it provides a secure data foundation that helps organizations protect and preserve their value. By centralizing and validating ESG and risk data, C-MORE enables firms to anticipate exposure before it becomes a headline.

And they're moving fast.

## How this ties to OpenBB

This is directly relevant.

Once you have high-quality data and a reliable AI layer, the next challenge is delivery - how you make it accessible, useful, and intuitive for end users.

Advising C-MORE gives me insight into how enterprise data vendors think about that last mile. We already have community members building apps in the OpenBB workspace and sharing them, but I see an opportunity at the enterprise level: enabling vendors to take our interface and own it with their branding.

We already have the enterprise features - user access controls, role-based permissions, app management, shared dashboards. And we let users connect data to AI agents in an AI-first workspace.

My recent conversations with Oscar have been nothing short of exciting.

**The first AI-native ESG Terminal may not be too far.**

Imagine C-MORE's verified, structured ESG data and AI agents wrapped in OpenBB's open, modular interface built for analysts and investors. I think we can offer their users an experience second to none.

## Looking ahead

Advising C-MORE gives me insight into what it takes to build a large-scale data business with purpose. It's a chance to learn from a team solving hard problems - and to help shape how AI can make complex data transparent, actionable, and impactful.

C-MORE is only getting started, but the trajectory is clear: the next generation of ESG intelligence will be built by those who combine clean data, strong AI, and beautiful interfaces loved by customers.

I'm excited about this side quest.

If you're dealing with ESG compliance, looking for better sustainability data infrastructure, or just curious about what C-MORE is building - reach out. I'm happy to share more or make introductions to the team.
