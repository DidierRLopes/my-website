I have moved countries. It turns out that there's a lot in common between these.</p><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div><p>Recently, I wrote a blogpost about the <a href="/blog/moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed">difference in culture between London and San Francisco</a>. I convinced my wife and dogs, packed our bags, and didn't look back. After all, I would live in the city with the highest density of builders per capita.</p><p><strong>But why?</strong></p><p>Most of my friends and family didn't understand why I would leave London. I liked the city, I enjoyed my lifestyle, I had friends, I played football with the same group every week, had dinner at the same restaurants, was close to family, and wouldn't be able to save money.</p><p>Logically speaking, this move didn't make any sense. No one really told me that I was doing the right thing, but internally, I knew I had to.</p><p>I believe this isn't so different from creating a startup. This blog post will explain what they have in common and why I did it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creating-a-startup--deciding-to-leave-yourcountry">Creating a startup / Deciding to leave your&nbsp;country<a href="#creating-a-startup--deciding-to-leave-yourcountry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Creating a startup / Deciding to leave your&nbsp;country" title="Direct link to Creating a startup / Deciding to leave your&nbsp;country">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://eladgil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elad Gil</a> wrote a really good <a href="https://blog.eladgil.com/p/startups-are-an-act-of-desperation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> on how creating a startup is an act of desperation. I believe that post could be equally applicable to moving countries, so I will list the same points used by Elad in the context of moving countries and provide examples. Most of the time, the person moving countries has a mix of the below bullet points.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Career desperation.</strong> Startups allow people early or stuck in their careers to jump a few steps ahead.</p></blockquote><br><p>This applies equally to moving, and is why I left Portugal to pursue an MSc at Imperial College London.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Financial desperation.</strong> If successful, a startup will also leapfrog you financially.</p></blockquote><br><p>This is the biggest motivation for people to move countries. This is why I was born in Switzerland, even though my parents are Portuguese. Having blue-collar jobs, they emigrated to a country with a better economy to provide my brother and me with a better life.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Product or mission desperation.</strong> The other reason startups often exist is that the founders are desperate for a product to exist in the world.</p></blockquote><br><p>In this case, it's the equivalent of hearing about Silicon Valley in documentaries or watching Steve Jobs presenting the iPhone in 2007. You cannot ignore that as an engineer, so you are desperate to move to be part of that tech scene.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Desperation to do something big or important, and to avoid wasted time.</strong> Some people want to "make a dent in the universe" and are motivated by doing something useful with their lives.</p></blockquote><br><p>This is what the "American dream" is all about. People moved to the US to do something bigger than themselves and achieve the promised dream.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Revenge vs the Arena</strong></p></blockquote><br><p>The equivalent to this is when someone returns to their home country after several years outside with more wealth and/or experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="growing-a-startup--livingabroad">Growing a startup / Living&nbsp;abroad<a href="#growing-a-startup--livingabroad" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Growing a startup / Living&nbsp;abroad" title="Direct link to Growing a startup / Living&nbsp;abroad">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mission-andvision">Mission and&nbsp;Vision<a href="#mission-andvision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Mission and&nbsp;Vision" title="Direct link to Mission and&nbsp;Vision">​</a></h3><p>When creating a company, you must have a clear mission and vision. This allows you to create a community/team that will be with you for the long run. Similarly, when moving countries, it's essential to have a well-defined goal. This doesn't mean that the goal cannot change; after all, companies pivot. However, you need to have a strategy that you follow until you don't.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="risk-and-uncertainty">Risk and Uncertainty<a href="#risk-and-uncertainty" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Risk and Uncertainty" title="Direct link to Risk and Uncertainty">​</a></h3><p>Startups and moving to a new country both involve stepping into the unknown. Entrepreneurs often take financial and personal risks, while those moving countries leave behind familiar surroundings, support systems, and sometimes even their careers. Uncertainty becomes a constant companion, demanding adaptability, problem-solving skills, and the ability to embrace change with open arms.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cultural-integration-and-networking">Cultural Integration and Networking<a href="#cultural-integration-and-networking" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cultural Integration and Networking" title="Direct link to Cultural Integration and Networking">​</a></h3><p>Building a successful startup requires networking, forming strategic partnerships, and understanding the market. Similarly, when moving countries, one must navigate cultural differences, learn new languages, and establish a network of contacts. Expanding social circles, building relationships, and immersing oneself in the local culture contribute to personal growth and enhance professional opportunities, just like in the startup world.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resilience-and-persistence">Resilience and Persistence<a href="#resilience-and-persistence" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Resilience and Persistence" title="Direct link to Resilience and Persistence">​</a></h3><p>Building a startup and moving countries demands unwavering resilience and persistence in facing challenges. Startups encounter setbacks, pivots, and failures, but successful entrepreneurs persist and learn from their experiences. Similarly, moving countries can bring unexpected hurdles, such as language barriers, difficulties making friends, challenges adapting to a new culture, or not finding a routine. Embracing these challenges with determination and adaptability paves the way for growth and achievement.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learning-andgrowth">Learning and&nbsp;Growth<a href="#learning-andgrowth" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Learning and&nbsp;Growth" title="Direct link to Learning and&nbsp;Growth">​</a></h3><p>Startups and moving countries are transformative experiences that offer immense personal and professional growth opportunities. Entrepreneurs continuously learn from their successes and failures in the startup world, refining their strategies and acquiring new skills. Likewise, moving countries provides a unique chance to learn about different cultures, broaden perspectives, and develop resilience, patience, and empathy. Both experiences foster personal development and shape individuals into more well-rounded and adaptable individuals.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-did-i-doit">Why did I do&nbsp;it?<a href="#why-did-i-doit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why did I do&nbsp;it?" title="Direct link to Why did I do&nbsp;it?">​</a></h2><p>The reason why I started OpenBB and also moved country is a combination of 2 factors:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-or-mission-desperation">Product or mission desperation.<a href="#product-or-mission-desperation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Product or mission desperation." title="Direct link to Product or mission desperation.">​</a></h3><p>On a startup level, I have experienced the need for an open-source investment research platform. That's why I wanted to create this platform, which was yet to exist. I think it wouldn't be possible if I didn't dedicate my time to it. This is why OpenBB's success is so important-it will enable millions of investors to have better access to data and better understand the financial market.</p><p>Growing up as an engineer fascinated by tech and innovation, the US has always been home to the biggest companies and hottest products. I've always been attracted to Silicon Valley, but before OpenBB, I never had the chance to. The first job I applied to after finishing university was Waymo in CA, but they didn't sponsor VISAs for that role.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="desperation-to-do-something-big-or-important">Desperation to do something big or important.&nbsp;<a href="#desperation-to-do-something-big-or-important" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Desperation to do something big or important.&nbsp;" title="Direct link to Desperation to do something big or important.&nbsp;">​</a></h3><p>On a startup level, I want to work on something bigger than myself. I want to solve a problem that no one has solved before and build something useful for millions of people that can withstand time.</p><p>I will do whatever it takes to build the first truly open-source investment research platform. Moving to SF increased my network opportunities with other entrepreneurs and builders from whom I can learn. I want to be fully immersed in this ecosystem and give it my all to do everything possible to help OpenBB succeed as a company, regardless of the outcome.</p><p>Note: A few weeks ago, I moved to NYC because I truly believe living here would increase the chances of OpenBB's success compared to living in SF.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/7943cde2-0230-4577-9f83-cc5b75b23f28" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The culture shock from moving to the Bay Area from London.</p><br><div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div><p>A few months ago, I wrote a blogpost about what was needed in order for my wife and our 2 dogs to move to the Bay Area from London. You can check that blog post <a href="/blog/leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco/">here</a>.</p><p>Since then, I’ve had some people asking me after living in the Bay for 1 year, what are the biggest differences I’ve experienced in terms of lifestyle &amp; culture.</p><p>I will write a section below for each of the major topics I experienced. Note that this is based on my experience, and you may disagree/have different opinions than me on some of these - which are very welcome.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="living-costs">Living costs<a href="#living-costs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Living costs" title="Direct link to Living costs">​</a></h2><p>Back in 2016 when I was at university, in Portugal, I used to pay 200 euros/month to live in an apartment with a roommate. My university cost was 800 euros/year and my parents gave me a monthly allowance of 300 euros/month to pay for food and anything else. I didn’t do many activities and would rarely go out, so I was able to live comfortably on that.</p><p>Once I moved to London (in 2017) to pursue a MSc. at Imperial College I was paying 1.6k £/month for a studio in Earl’s Court. This was walking distance from Imperial (didn’t have to pay for transportation) and was cheaper than the accommodations that the university offered. The university was no longer 800 euros/year, it cost £11k for the entire MSc (1 year).</p><p>So there was a shock that I experienced in terms of living costs from Lisbon to London.</p><p>Once I decided to move to the Bay Area (2023) I knew that the living costs were going to be higher, but in my head “how higher can these be?”.</p><p>Oh boy.</p><p>Apparently, a lot.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shopping">Shopping<a href="#shopping" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shopping" title="Direct link to Shopping">​</a></h3><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/eadb52a7-c6d8-4296-8cf9-540bff3393d9" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This was the first shopping trip I had in the Bay (Whole foods is the equivalent to Waitrose in London, I often still confuse them and my wife finds it funny - anyway, they call it whole paycheck here bc $$$). These 10 items cost me $69.34. I couldn’t believe it.</p><p>Costco is arguably my favorite shop. It’s like a better IKEA. We would spend at least 2 hours shopping but we would get supplies for 3 weeks, the famous hot dog/pizza combo and put gas in the car. The membership (120$/year) pays itself really fast at Costco. The main downside is that since we were only 2 and I hate throwing food out, it happened a few times that I had to adapt my meals to make sure no food would go to waste. E.g. Eat a guacamole pack a day since the smaller pack brings 24 and it there were 24 days until the expiry date.</p><p>PS: I like Costco so much that I always took the friends/family who visited to it, as if it was an attraction. Sometimes we would even go directly to Costco from the airport, to breathe in Costco and all its magnificence upon arrival :D</p><p align="center" class="flex items-center gap-2 justify-center"><img loading="lazy" width="300" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/4b235954-14a9-4e9f-aec2-02945f8285a0" class="img_ev3q"><img loading="lazy" width="300" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/86a0e9a6-1bb2-4e74-b88c-9c6710a825b3" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="apartment">Apartment<a href="#apartment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Apartment" title="Direct link to Apartment">​</a></h3><p>Since I went to the US with the sole purpose of working hard and making OpenBB successful, I ended up picking a nice apartment in San Mateo - given that we spend 90% of our time at home. Our monthly rent for a 2-bedroom flat was 4.4k $/month with everything included (including both dogs rent, lol).</p><p>The apartment had a small gym, a common pool &amp; bbq area and an outdoor hot tub. But more importantly, it was located right by 101, walking distance from Peets &amp; Starbucks and very pet friendly. In addition, I was 40m from SF, 10m from the airport and 20m from Palo Alto. This meant that we were in a very calm area whilst being close to the most important hubs.</p><p>The common pool and BBQ area (+ the sunny weather) were insane, sometimes I wish I had spent more time there. But I guess you tend to value things more when you don’t have them :)</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/e4593db6-2e09-4a02-bed8-75960c0ffbe6" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tipping-culture">Tipping culture<a href="#tipping-culture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tipping culture" title="Direct link to Tipping culture">​</a></h3><p>In Europe, I very very rarely tipped. Not just me, but all people I know. It’s just not part of our culture. Everything is factored in. Even in London, most restaurants will have a “service charge” which is kind of a tip BUT it’s included in the bill and so you don’t need to think about how much you are going to tip.</p><p>In the US, if you don’t tip - people will judge you. The system is done in a way that tipping is not a “should” but closer to a “must”. Workers rely on your tips when thinking about their total compensation. And now I understand why my friends who work in restaurants/cafes enjoy Americans so much, it’s because they bring their tipping culture to Europe and so that extra money is very meaningful for European folks.</p><p>Some rules that I follow:</p><ul><li>If I go to a coffee shop and just do takeaway, I don’t tip. If I sit down in a table, then I tip between 15-20%.</li><li>When in a restaurant, I always tip. But the percentage varies based on the quality of the service and food. If I didn’t like it, I still tip 10%. If I really enjoy it then I tip 20%. If it was just good, I do 15%. This is a rule of thumb. In practice, I do this but then round to a multiple of $5 because yes (this is the equivalent to my wife not allowing odd numbers as the TV volume).</li></ul><p>The best way to get used to this is to just internally assume that 20% extra cost on whatever you are seeing on the menu. If a burger + drink costs $30, assume it will be $36 after taxes and tip.</p><p>Note that in restaurants they expect you to leave your credit card on the top of the bill. This is so they can “freeze” the bill and once they bring the receipt back they will wait for you to add the amount for the tip (+ total). Once you fill this and sign (in theory, the signing is mandatory) - only then they will be able to withdraw the bill amount + the tip.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/51f2ba37-9c6c-4650-8ca2-814832776b1b" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sports">Sports<a href="#sports" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sports" title="Direct link to Sports">​</a></h2><p>Growing up in Portugal I used to watch every Benfica game and then in high school you would talk about the games you watched during the weekend. There was no other sport, it was a binary - either you are a soccer fan or you don’t watch any sports at all. When I moved to London, this changed slightly, there were people that liked other sports but Soccer was still the main sport by a very big margin. People would fill up a pub to watch Soccer only - maybe the other sport that came closest was Cricket.</p><p>In the US, people don’t really care about Soccer. It feels like it’s a sport that kids do, but adults don’t really talk about it or watch it. They know about Messi/Ronaldo, but aren’t really fans. On the other hand, American football, Basketball and Baseball are very big. Aquatic pole also seems to be popular in the Bay Area.</p><p>I remember when we got the apartment, I was walking my dogs and there was a soccer pitch nearby. I was super happy because I thought that I could do what I used to do in London and just show up to the ground on the weekend and do a pick-up play with random folks. Unfortunately, after several attempts of walking nearby I realized that the pitch was only used for kids to play soccer and never adults. In London, on a sunny day, it’s hard (maybe impossible?) to find a soccer field empty.</p><p align="center" class="flex items-center gap-2 justify-center"><img loading="lazy" width="300" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/cb761c23-af50-4b6e-a9a8-77d61d8308f3" class="img_ev3q"><img loading="lazy" width="300" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/1c6ff214-3d26-4dba-b6a5-43cf372daa30" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="college-sports">College sports<a href="#college-sports" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to College sports" title="Direct link to College sports">​</a></h3><p>While in Europe in general, no one cares about college sports. The reality in the US is completely different. Not only do they fill their stadiums with 50k+ people, but these games bring a TON of money. People will literally sit outside the stadium in the morning and wait for the time of the match. It’s called tailgating.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/2410db28-8a94-4dd2-abc4-fedda21f69cf" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I’ve noticed that some people don’t even go to the stadium, they just sit outside the stadium watching the game in the car park on their TV and drinking. I still don’t fully get why you would do that, but I guess it’s a tradition.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/5865346c-c9d2-4591-b59b-4a32fd793ba8" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="working-culture">Working Culture<a href="#working-culture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Working Culture" title="Direct link to Working Culture">​</a></h2><p>My plan was to live in the US for the duration of my visa (O-1) and then return after 3 years. But the working culture is the reason why I hope to stay for longer. Most people you will meet in the Bay work very hard. They don’t finish the day at 5/6pm but do long hours to get shit done. What motivates them is building the future and being part of something bigger than themselves.</p><p>In London, I felt like the culture was very strong towards finishing your working day and going to the pub at 5/6pm - get drunk. And then repeat. Before London I didn’t drink alcohol, and in London I started drinking sometimes to socialize. In the Bay I feel like there isn’t an expectation that everyone wants to drink, and people leave events early because they want to head home to work on something - which is something I used to do back in London.</p><p>I also feel like in the Bay Area, when you go to events you can talk about what you are working on without people judging you for bringing “work” into the conversation. And I tend to find these conversations more interesting. In London, there’s less emphasis in tech, and the interests tend to be a bit broader: music, arts, history, etc..</p><p>While people say that London is a big hub for startups &amp; founders, I didn’t find this to be the case. In the Bay Area, the likelihood of you encountering someone on the street and them working at a startup (most of the time their own) is really high. You can even feel the strength of this tech community on Twitter, whereas that doesn’t exist (AFAIK) in London.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/de60d56a-194e-4f62-8aaa-20e3451936e1" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Elad Gil fireside with Satya Nadella at Stripe's HQ</p><p></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="equity-as-part-of-compensation-package">Equity as part of compensation package<a href="#equity-as-part-of-compensation-package" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Equity as part of compensation package" title="Direct link to Equity as part of compensation package">​</a></h3><p>Most European startups do not offer any equity. In the Bay Area, all startups offer equity. The earlier you join (higher risk) the more meaningful the options you get are. One of the reasons this works is because US employees are, in general, hard-working and will go the long way for their company. So this makes it so that incentives are aligned, and employees want to work harder because that equity can become much more meaningful than their base salary (potentially life-changing).</p><p>One of the reasons this works so well is that pretty much every US person knows someone in firsthand who made f-u money by selling their shares in secondaries, or has at least heard stories about this. While I was in the UK, before starting OpenBB, I didn’t hear about this once. Also because companies have no interest in offering you equity if they don’t have to.</p><p>E.g. at my previous startup I used to stay working late into the night, because in my perspective this would increase the startup's chances of success. However, I had no equity. So this meant that if the startup was wildly successful, I would have no direct gains from it and the company would not owe me anything. Offering equity through a typical 4-year vesting schedule (with 1-year cliff) provides the perfect type of alignment.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="holidays">Holidays<a href="#holidays" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Holidays" title="Direct link to Holidays">​</a></h3><p>The amount of holidays is a good example that demonstrates the hard-working culture that so well characterizes the US. In the US they are used to having 2-weeks off in a full calendar year. In London, most companies offer at least 4-weeks, which is effectively 2x the number of holidays.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="driving-culture">Driving culture<a href="#driving-culture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Driving culture" title="Direct link to Driving culture">​</a></h2><p>The London underground works impressively, I lived there for 5 years and never once even considered owning a car.</p><p>I thought I could do the same in the US and people were being dramatic. That thought lasted maybe 2 days?</p><p>On the first day I had to go to Fedex which was a 15-20m walk, and when I told the apartment administrator that I was going to walk there she looked at me like I was crazy and said “you need to take your car”. After walking there I understood what she meant and that unless you are in a city, the pedestrian sidewalks/roads just aren’t prepared for pedestrians.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="differences">Differences<a href="#differences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Differences" title="Direct link to Differences">​</a></h3><ul><li>You drive on the right (x2) side of the road. Since I didn’t drive in the UK, this was very easy for me as I’m used to driving in Portugal where we also drive on the right side of the road.</li><li>In the UK (or Europe, in general) having more than 3 lanes on the highway is atypical. In the US, having 6 lanes it’s considered normal. Sometimes it’s tricky and you can’t be in the most right side because the 2 right lanes may both exit and thus you need to hop over 2 lanes to keep on the same route. This mistake can be costly.</li><li>There are very very few roundabouts in the Bay. There are a LOT of intersections. I like it less (not because I think it’s slower) but because it’s more “boring” to wait for the green light and from my point of view, people are more likely to grab their phone during that time because they don’t need to pay as much attention, at least compared to a roundabout where you are waiting for an opening to keep moving. (there are so few roundabouts that the first time I saw one I took a picture to share with my wife)</li><li>There’s a “Right on Red” policy. This means that if you are at an intersection and it’s red for you to proceed if there’s no incoming car from the left side you can turn right on the red. I like this because it allows for traffic to flow better. My wife doesn’t like it because as a pedestrian sometimes cars start accelerating and don’t respect pedestrian as much. Nonetheless, I love to make this joke when people from Europe visit, where I say that I’m going to pass a red and they are shocked when they see me turning right on a red light.</li><li>In the Bay they have FastTrack which allows people to pay to use the most-left lane and avoid traffic. Although this is capitalist I like it because if I’m in a rush I can pay a few dollars to avoid the congestion - it’s a type of SaaS - Speed as a Service 😄</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="waymo">Waymo<a href="#waymo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Waymo" title="Direct link to Waymo">​</a></h3><p>Waymo, a self-driving car division that started off Google, was the first startup I applied to when I finished university. I have been bullish on self-driving cars since university - my dissertation was on that topic and I had to propose it myself, since there were no proposals for such. So seeing Waymo operating in SF was mind-blowing to me.</p><p>Autonomous cars are a matter of time - and SF (and the Bay Area) being the city where Waymo starts operating, shows a lot about how progressive this city is. I recommend everyone to try one out.</p><p>My dad, someone who was born and raised in a small town in Portugal, and who understands very little about technology seeing this was something. Him seated in the passenger’s seat for the full 16 min drive recording a wheel with no driver and ending the journey telling me “I never thought I would see this in my life, thank you” is something that no amount of money in this world could buy.</p><p align="center" class="flex items-center gap-2 justify-center"><img loading="lazy" width="300" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/20ca7ae8-6eb8-4059-9d1b-006f73c1ca58" class="img_ev3q"><img loading="lazy" width="300" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/f63f7ff1-91b0-4124-adb6-6d1780eb37fc" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="driving-license">Driving license<a href="#driving-license" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Driving license" title="Direct link to Driving license">​</a></h3><p>Even though I have a Portuguese driving license since I was 18. That’s only accepted for 10 days or so - and if you have an international driving license for it to work for longer (I didn’t go this route). So I had to apply for a California Driving License (CDL) which meant taking a written exam and doing a driving test.</p><p>The written exam was actually fairly easy compared to the one I had in Portugal. In the Bay, the test consists of 36 multiple-choice questions, and you are allowed to fail up to 6 questions.  In Portugal I had 30 multiple-choice questions and could only fail up to 3.</p><p>I found the written exam to be easy after doing multiple practice tests online. Most of the questions ended up being somewhat similar to the ones I had practiced the day before.</p><p>Doing the written exam was very different though. In Portugal we did it in a closed room with someone watching us and everyone else in silence. In the Bay Area I did it in a corner of the DMV with a lot of background noise behind me. I had to use both my hands to cover my ears to be able to focus, which was annoying.</p><p>The driving exam is much easier than the one I did in Portugal. It lasted for maybe 20-25 minutes and it was just around the DMV. When doing it in Portugal, the test lasts 40 minutes and includes: parallel parking, reversing while tracking a curb (without touching it), stopping in a hill (harder when driving with a stick), roundabout and highway.</p><p>Also, the DMV is as bad as they say it is. This movie scene is pretty accurate:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/bfd90829-f114-43bb-960c-856b31272433" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cards">Cards<a href="#cards" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cards" title="Direct link to Cards">​</a></h2><p>In the US, as in the UK, the driving license acts as citizen card. Even if you don’t drive it’s worth getting your drivers license since everywhere you go that is used for you to prove who you are.</p><p>When doing anything official in the UK, you get asked about your passport (and the passport number). That ID is all they need to recognize who you are. In the US you have a Social Security Number (SSN) which is this super-confidential number that you are meant to keep secret, yet they keep asking you about it when you rent an apartment, set up a phone plan, go to the doctor, buy a car, … It’s a weird concept. The difference is that in the UK if someone gets your passport number, nothing really happens. In the US if someone gets your SSN, it can be used to commit fraud, open new credit and bank accounts, obtain employment, and access medical care or other benefits.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="debit-vs-credit-card">Debit vs credit card<a href="#debit-vs-credit-card" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Debit vs credit card" title="Direct link to Debit vs credit card">​</a></h3><p>In Portugal and the UK, I only had a Debit card which had access to all the cash in the bank. When moving to the Bay Area, everyone told me to get a credit card and leave the debit card at home. There are a lot of scams in the US, and having a credit card is safer since banks limit the withdrawal amounts based on your credit score and will protect in case of theft.</p><p>In the UK, there isn’t a concept of a credit score - at least publicly. Banks will have something like that based on how on time you pay for things, but it’s only used internally for loans or others. In the US, everything revolves around your credit score. The amount of money you can withdraw from your credit card, the loans you get, the apartments you can rent, … so it’s important to pay everything on time and avoid debt.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="employment">Employment<a href="#employment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Employment" title="Direct link to Employment">​</a></h2><p>Employment in the US is very different from the one in the UK. </p><p>In the UK, you get paid a value at the end of the month that corresponds to the value you take home and the employer handles both your Income taxes and the National insurance (which goes to the NHS).</p><p>In the US, you need to handle your taxes at the end of a fiscal year. There are multiple taxes applied and hence it’s not as simple as the tax system that exists in the UK.</p><p>In addition, there isn’t a public “free” NHS (healthcare) in the United States. As an individual, you need to select the plan you are interested in (based on a few choices that your employer offers you). Hence you need to consider not only what the monthly premium entails, but how the deductible works - and as weird as it sounds you need to “estimate” your likelihood of getting into an accident to select something that works for you. This is hard to grasp coming from a country where there’s “free” healthcare and everyone has access to the same services.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="others">Others<a href="#others" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Others" title="Direct link to Others">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="student-debt">Student debt<a href="#student-debt" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Student debt" title="Direct link to Student debt">​</a></h3><p>In Portugal, the concept of student debt doesn’t really exist. In general, parents pay their kids' tuition. This is possible because the tuition costs for public universities aren’t very high.</p><p>In the UK, students tend to have student debt since university costs can be rather expensive (e.g. around 10k pounds/year). </p><p>In the US, student debt is much higher. We are talking about starting a career with 300k in student loans, which is absolutely wild.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="phone-plan">Phone plan<a href="#phone-plan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Phone plan" title="Direct link to Phone plan">​</a></h3><p>While I was paying around 8 pounds/month for my UK phone plan with unlimited data. For a similar plan in the US, the cost is around 70 $/month. A funny story about this is when I bought my phone plan, they told me that the cost was 70$ for their cheapest plan and I thought they meant yearly. When they told me it was monthly, I had to call my co-founder to make sure this wasn’t a rip-off. To which he said: “Welcome to the US”.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guns--alcohol">Guns &amp; Alcohol<a href="#guns--alcohol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Guns &amp; Alcohol" title="Direct link to Guns &amp; Alcohol">​</a></h3><p>In the UK (and Europe in general), it’s illegal to own a gun and you can start drinking at 18 years old. In the US, you can buy a gun as soon as you are 18 but aren’t allowed to drink until 21. </p><p>And also, Kinder Surprise is illegal in the US because of the toy that comes inside. So you can’t buy a chocolate with a toy inside because you can choke on it, but can go to the store to buy a gun.</p><p align="center" class="flex items-center gap-2 justify-center"><img loading="lazy" width="300" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/1f334692-401b-47ad-a89f-ac5755e8e747" class="img_ev3q"><img loading="lazy" width="300" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/a4410b7c-db8b-4739-be67-a3f4b4bdc466" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dog-parks">Dog Parks<a href="#dog-parks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dog Parks" title="Direct link to Dog Parks">​</a></h3><p>One of my all-time favorite things in the US and that Europe in general should learn from. The US has a LOT of dog parks. These are spaces that are gated where people bring their dogs for them to play together. These spaces come fully prepared with water, bags, cleaning kits and even seats. I’ve seen friends hang out at the park while their dogs are having fun playing with other dogs. These parks usually also have 2 areas, one for smaller and one for larger dogs - which is great since we have a small pomeranian.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/c6f28500-4ba6-48f3-a68e-28a34b401e85" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>Overall, I'm very happy that I moved to the US. I think it was the right decision for both the company and my family. Plus the network that I'm building between other founders, customers and investors is something that I couldn't have done in Europe.</p>]]></content>

For PDF document specifically, the Copilot will also source the specific page that was used to answer your query.</p><video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/e35a0b2c-8150-4d2b-9743-a72862ba3b6d"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-if-you-dont-want-to-use-our-copilot">What if you don't want to use our copilot?<a href="#what-if-you-dont-want-to-use-our-copilot" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What if you don't want to use our copilot?" title="Direct link to What if you don't want to use our copilot?">​</a></h2><p>You don’t have to.

Elon Musk sleeping at the gigafactory to show his team that he was there next to them.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-be-curious-and-humble-enough-to-be-willing-to-ask-dumb-questions">2.

I love that type of posts, and wish there was a similar trend going on for UX improvements.</p><p>While UI is critical to attract users, UX is king to retain them.</p><p>It’s like dating - the looks is in the UI and the personality is the UX.</p><p>While they may be perceived as their own separate bubble, they are not.

And by hard data I mean a spreadsheet with numbers or a powerpoint with charts.</p><p>However, you do have that data. It’s just not in a clean format and lives on your head.</p><p>This data has been aggregating by spending more time thinking about the problem you are solving than anyone else, by talking with customers, by talking with partners, and everything in between.</p><p>Trust your intuition, more often than not presentations are done to justify decisions that you knew were right all along.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/4ca4c4a8-99bd-45b8-b7c9-3a43577c620e" class="img_ev3q"></p><br><p>We acknowledged the enduring centrality of Excel in the financial sector, so we're now making data from the Terminal Pro readily available in Excel. We're also excitedly working to integrate the "Bring Your Own Data" feature into our Excel Add-in, a move we foresee as a transformative step in the financial data industry.</p><div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2><p>Building something people truly want requires direct engagement with them. After conducting over 100 interviews with analysts and quants, three key insights surfaced:</p><ol><li><p>The financial world runs on Excel.</p></li><li><p>The primary value of the OpenBB Terminal Pro lies in its customization (bring your own data + widget/dashboard creation) and AI features.</p></li><li><p>The financial world, <strong>LITERALLY</strong>, still runs on Excel.</p></li></ol><p>For topic number 2, we were well underway towards building the <a href="https://openbb.co/products/pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terminal Pro</a> as the most customizable and efficient financial terminal.</p><p>But for topics number 1 and 3, we weren’t.</p><p>So we devised a small task force to tackle this effort and work with design partners towards building the <a href="https://openbb.co/products/excel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenBB Add-in for Excel</a>.</p><p>The goal was simple: <strong>financial data available on the Terminal Pro should be accessible in Excel</strong>.</p><p>But as we do for all our products, we wanted to understand where this product would sit in our ecosystem.</p><p>Since the Terminal Pro offers a basic data tier (including historical price, fundamentals, analyst estimates, news, macro-economy, and forex) with redistribution rights, we decided to make those same datasets available in Excel.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/9a37a99b-cc82-42a6-a322-4db6e0d124da" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="getting-started">Getting Started<a href="#getting-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Getting Started" title="Direct link to Getting Started">​</a></h2><p>So, in simple terms, we allow the user to access financial data right from Excel, by connecting with the OpenBB server to do the data request.</p><p>In the example below you can see that we are using the formula <code>=OBB.EQUITY.ESTIMATES.PRICE_TARGET("AAPL")</code> which retrieves the latest data about AAPL’s price target.</p><p>You can read more information about it in our <a href="https://docs.openbb.co/excel/reference/equity/estimates/price_target" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Documentation</a>.</p><p>This is how it looks:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/5e8e2dbd-000e-4f84-8fce-654117b1ddf7" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This was a huge step for us.</p><p>However, another question came up:</p><p><strong>As the datasets keep expanding, discoverability will become a big problem.</strong></p><p>And we haven’t been around for 40 years for users to be familiar with our terminology.</p><p>So, how would users know what function to use, to access the datasets they are interested in?</p><p>We figured that enterprise users would be interested in accessing the data they are already visualizing in the <a href="https://openbb.co/products/pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenBB Terminal Pro</a>.</p><p>So we allowed them to get the Excel function directly from each widget:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/3cfc1276-ee52-4759-8903-eff92542ece9" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>After clicking on the “Functions” button in the ellipsis icon of the widget data you are interested in, this is what a user sees:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/c6c6c5de-fdb9-4a02-9530-f9a1d039527f" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="templates">Templates<a href="#templates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Templates" title="Direct link to Templates">​</a></h2><p>Since <a href="https://my.openbb.co/app/pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenBB Terminal Pro</a> users are used to the templates they have access to with our product, e.g. our equity analyst template:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/09c074fd-e6e1-4c53-90bc-14451b585d1a" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We ensured that similar templates were available for the Excel Add-in, and you can find them <a href="https://my.openbb.co/app/excel/templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/7b3be142-ee3e-4023-b4a3-c04443225f12" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What's Next<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's Next" title="Direct link to What's Next">​</a></h2><p>Last but not least, we are working on the upcoming integration of the "Bring Your Own Data" (BYOD) feature into our Excel Add-in.</p><p>Until now, this capability has been exclusive to the OpenBB Terminal Pro and is a <strong>cornerstone of our offering</strong>.</p><p>But it doesn’t have to stop there.</p><p>Our foundation on an open-source platform empowers us to facilitate open data access across multiple interfaces, whether through the Terminal Pro or the Excel Add-in.</p><p>We expect this to be a complete game-changer in the industry. While numerous financial Excel add-ins exist, they lack the flexibility to seamlessly incorporate third-party or proprietary datasets.</p><p>We are currently working with design partners on this. So if this sounds like something you are interested in - please reach out.</p><p>We have a 5,000+ <a href="https://my.openbb.co/app/pro/early-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waitlist</a> to the Terminal Pro and have already started onboarding users. As part of the Terminal Pro free trial, you will be granted access to the OpenBB Add-in for Excel as long as you have Microsoft Excel.</p><p>Wondering how to get started easily?

Given that I knew 0 to nothing last year, I am extremely happy with my progress.</p><p>I never had the time to fully dedicate to it in terms of doing a program/course — but as with anything in life, the best way to learn is by doing.</p><p>And this year I worked on web development for:</p><ul><li>OpenBB Hub — <a href="https://my.openbb.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://my.openbb.co</a></li><li>OpenBB marketing website — <a href="https://openbb.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://openbb.co</a></li><li>OpenBB docs — <a href="https://docs.openbb.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.openbb.co</a></li><li>OpenBB Terminal Pro — <a href="https://pro.openbb.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pro.openbb.co</a></li></ul><p>Thank you José Donato for always helping me with anything!</p><p>In addition, I’ve always wanted to have my own personal website. So I felt that this would be the perfect opportunity to do so as I could spend some time with it over weekends.</p><p>And so I did, and open source here: <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/personal-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/DidierRLopes/personal-website</a></p><p>However, this website was taking too much of my spare time, which I could use for more important work. And at the time I became very familiar with Docusaurus, which is what we use for OpenBB docs.</p><p>So I thought — why not just use Docusaurus to make my personal website? It’s easy to edit, I’m already very familiar with the architecture, and it’s very easy to update when there’s new information.</p><p>So that’s what I did, and also made the entire code open source here: <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website</a></p><p>You can access the full website here — <a href="https://didierlopes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://didierlopes.com/</a>, and there you can find: my personal projects, books I’ve read or want to read, interviews/webinars/podcasts, resume or even my blog.</p><p>Any feedback is welcome.</p>]]></content>

Instead of relying on one-size-fits-all solutions, companies will look towards the integration of multiple, fine-tuned language models tailored for specific actions.</p><p>Enterprises are recognizing the importance of accuracy in their AI applications. General-purpose language models have been revolutionary, but the demand for specialized models is on the rise. From customer support interactions to complex data analysis, having dedicated language models for specific tasks enhances accuracy and efficiency. This is easy to understand since the weights that are being used for the LLM to have a big breadth of knowledge are repurposed for depth.</p><p>Personalization is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Specialized language models enable enterprises to deliver personalized experiences to their customers. We have to assume that everyone is utilizing the same models today, so offering ChatGPT in your product isn’t good enough. You need to add alpha to it. And that is done through fine-tuning utilizing your private data.</p><p>In an era of increasing cyber threats and stringent regulations, the deployment of fine-tuned language models allows enterprises to enhance their security measures and ensure compliance with industry standards.</p><p>As for the financial industry, this is 100% going to happen. Firms will fine-tune language models locally utilizing their proprietary datasets and providing access to their Snowflake/Elastic/ClickHouse/.. instances. This collection of models will effectively enhance the productivity of the firm by 2/3x, even displacing jobs.</p><p>We are preparing for this shift at OpenBB and I spent the last few days working on a proof-of-concept with José Donato that will allow users to bring their own copilots to the Terminal Pro. And even have these interact with each other.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/5ce7fefe-b5d2-4f91-81dd-a591bb4e86f3" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For a video on how this works you can check: <a href="https://x.com/josedonato__/status/1741151037031845986?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/josedonato__/status/1741151037031845986?s=20</a></p>]]></content>

The architecture involves task decomposition, tool retrieval, and subtask agents, showcasing impressive results in both deterministic and non-deterministic workflows. Read on to explore its capabilities and don't forget to watch the demos.</p><p>The open source code is available <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h2><p>At OpenBB, we have been thinking deeply about how AI will impact the lives of analysts and quants. We recently <a href="https://openbb.co/blog/goodbye-openbb-sdk-hello-openbb-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the OpenBB Platform</a> and have refactored it from the ground up to make it easier and simpler for quants/developers to access financial data. In addition, we hired a new head of AI to lead our AI efforts - you can read more about it <a href="https://openbb.co/blog/revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>I did a 20-minute presentation at the Open Core Summit on this topic that you can watch here:</p><div class="flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-43EKK2PhE?si=o_lO_lVLpWwwfbvF" width="800" height="400"></iframe></div><br><p>Otherwise, the following post will summarize what we presented.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-powered-financial-analyst-roadmap">AI-Powered financial analyst roadmap<a href="#ai-powered-financial-analyst-roadmap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AI-Powered financial analyst roadmap" title="Direct link to AI-Powered financial analyst roadmap">​</a></h2><p>When discussing what tasks we wanted our AI-powered Financial Analyst to be able to perform, we arrived at the following levels (in order of complexity):</p><ol><li><p><strong>Knowledge retrieval</strong>: The agent can answer general financial queries without external resources. (eg. ChatGPT "as-is"). Here, the agent relies solely on its training data to answer questions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data retrieval</strong>: The agent can answer queries using information inserted into the context (usually as part of a separate data retrieval process that isn’t controlled by the model, such as using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">similarity search</a> across a knowledge database using the user’s query).</p></li><li><p><strong>Autonomous data retrieval</strong>: The agent can answer queries by dynamically retrieving data not currently present in the context or the training data via function calling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complex workflow execution</strong>: The agent can reason and answer queries that require a logical arrangement of knowledge retrieval, data retrieval, and autonomous data retrieval calling. It includes action planning and decision-making.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fully autonomous analyst</strong>: The agent can do all of the above but is self-directed. The agent can dynamically generate additional hypotheses, modify plans of action, and retrieve the necessary data, all while mid-workflow. The agent can make arguments for certain decisions, carry a discussion on the topic, and reason with you.</p></li></ol><p>Our goal is to enable OpenBB Copilot to perform all of the above. I presented a demo of how it would work in this video:</p><div class="flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1rYmWWVbIY?si=ShScenxTI4bHtERS" width="800" height="400"></iframe></div><br><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="two-types-of-prompts">Two types of prompts<a href="#two-types-of-prompts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Two types of prompts" title="Direct link to Two types of prompts">​</a></h2><p>Rather than first building an AI-powered financial analyst for the sake of it, we instead started from what we wanted to achieve. We came up with two distinct prompts and our goal was for the agent to be able to successfully perform both of these, but utilizing the same underlying “agentic” architecture.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/f36f6e07-de22-4373-b871-cc262f5ac2f8" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><p><strong>Prompt A (on the left)</strong> - requires linear reasoning (where future answers depend on previous answers). This kind of prompt is generally deterministic, which allows us to access (and verify) the agent’s answers immediately because we can check the underlying facts and data. It also involves a few complex operations across multiple steps, such as extracting a list of tickers from an endpoint and iterating through that list using a different endpoint. Then based on those outputs, a reasoning can be made and a final answer is given.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prompt B (on the right)</strong> - requires independent reasoning (fetching and combining different pieces of independent information). This prompt is typically less deterministic and allows us to leverage LLMs to provide alpha by uncovering insights that would be hard for a human to discover (or, at the very least, discover at scale). Instead of telling the agent what to do explicitly, we instead pose a question and expect the agent to execute an analysis and perform reasoning, without specific guidance or guardrails.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="openbb-platform">OpenBB Platform<a href="#openbb-platform" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OpenBB Platform" title="Direct link to OpenBB Platform">​</a></h2><p>Getting started with our Platform is extremely easy (docs <a href="https://docs.openbb.co/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). All you need is <code>pip install openbb</code> and you are ready to access 100+ different datasets.</p><p>We standardize the data so that you can read our docs once and interact with the Platform the same way, regardless of the type of data you are looking at.</p><p>In addition, using the OpenBB Hub, you can set up your API keys which we can manage on your behalf, and all you need to access data via OpenBB is a Personal Access Token.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/7600e1c8-7fd9-423f-80e1-f7fc31d797ea" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Crucially, we use Pydantic for all of our endpoints. This ensures that we have both structured inputs and structured outputs. This is extremely important as we feed these models into our agent so that it understands both the input schema during function calling, but also the output schema of the resulting function call. This is standardized across multiple data vendors across the OpenBB Platform.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/f94e4ced-b9f0-4011-b41f-99721f023211" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="openbb-tools">OpenBB Tools<a href="#openbb-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OpenBB Tools" title="Direct link to OpenBB Tools">​</a></h3><p>From having 100+ different data endpoints that you can access using Python, we created “tools” that an agent “understands” and can use. This is extremely important since this collection of tools will give real-time data to the agent based on the prompt asked.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/ff27b0c4-2d10-4b9c-aa7d-a64361741ce3" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Since the OpenBB Platform has high-quality documentation, we use each function’s docstring as well as the output field names (with some basic preprocessing). This tweak allows the agent to know where to get the market cap information from, even if it’s within a differently-named endpoint (for example the <code>equity.fundamentals.overview</code> endpoint).</p><p>Each of these tool descriptions is converted into embeddings that can be retrieved later on based on the query the user provides. This allows our agent to pick the right tools for the job - i.e. if I want to have access to Apple’s market cap, I want to get the tool <code>equity.fundamentals.overview</code> because I know that by providing the symbol <code>AAPL</code> I can get the market cap value.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/e5ecf460-e52d-4a4f-8b4a-7071a2a328c0" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So, we create a vector store using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) and OpenAIEmbeddings, although any vector store with similarity search would also work.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="openbb-agent-architecture">OpenBB Agent Architecture<a href="#openbb-agent-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OpenBB Agent Architecture" title="Direct link to OpenBB Agent Architecture">​</a></h2><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/a16beb5a-e08d-42d6-ad5b-cdc7ceed792b" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is the overall architecture that our agent will follow, and below we will talk about each of these components individually.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="task-decomposition">Task Decomposition<a href="#task-decomposition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Task Decomposition" title="Direct link to Task Decomposition">​</a></h3><p>First of all, we don’t want to tackle the user query in one go. This is because LLMs have limited context. Plus, we want the agent to retrieve all the necessary tools to answer the query. But the vector’s store similarity search doesn’t work with one prompt that needs multiple different tools. Additionally, similar to human analysts, breaking a larger question up into smaller manageable subquestions leads to better analysis and results.</p><p>So, we break the user’s main query into:</p><ul><li><p><strong>List of simpler tasks</strong>: self-explanatory</p></li><li><p><strong>List of tasks dependency</strong>: does the current subtask need a prior subtask to tackle the current subtask?</p></li><li><p><strong>List of “tool search” keywords associated with each subtask</strong>: instead of using the subtask question itself to directly retrieve the correct selection of tools using the embeddings in the vector store, empirically we found that if the LLM could select the most important keywords associated with the task using keyword search. This ended up resulting in a big jump in retrieval performance. This is expected since we are effectively reducing the noise. E.g. “What are Tesla peers” → “peers”.</p></li></ul><p>This is the system message we are utilizing:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/3e0c6078-5bb8-4ef8-aac7-9c3daefaa724" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>To ensure that we have a structured output with the format specified, we create a Pydantic Data model to be used as format in the instruction:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/f6d768d6-e4e1-4996-a7ba-3a08781fec40" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is what the code looks like, and you can see that the <code>PydanticOutputParser</code> goes into the <code>format_instructions</code>:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/30c339cd-4f13-47a3-9a0d-06c9580f38b0" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tool-retrieval">Tool Retrieval<a href="#tool-retrieval" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tool Retrieval" title="Direct link to Tool Retrieval">​</a></h3><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/c125ec7f-8d71-4353-a6bb-244c71f787e2" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is the function that the agent uses to retrieve the right subset of tools to answer each of the subtasks. Empirically, we found good results by using the similarity score threshold of 0.65. In other words, we retrieve all tools with descriptions that return a better similarity score than that value. In the case where the search yields less than two tools, we return the 2 tools with the highest similarity score instead.</p><p>As previously mentioned, you can see that we are not using the subtask query itself but the keywords associated with it. The embeddings of the keywords are (from experimentation) closer to the embeddings of the correct docstring by focusing solely on a few keywords rather than the entire sentence.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/70f83560-1e40-436b-858a-d4775774cb71" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="subtask-agents">Subtask Agents<a href="#subtask-agents" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Subtask Agents" title="Direct link to Subtask Agents">​</a></h3><p>Each subtask agent is provided with the original query from the user, one of the subtasks from the task decomposition step, the output from another subtask agent IF there was a subtask dependency AND a set of retrieved tools necessary to answer the subtask.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/be82b3fd-af6f-47df-88f9-ad456e45a05c" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is what the agent looks like:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/96ddbfc8-d9ad-44d4-af5b-30d7e626656e" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-agent">Final Agent<a href="#final-agent" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Final Agent" title="Direct link to Final Agent">​</a></h3><p>We then combine the entire context from subquestions and outputs to be given to the final agent:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/e2fe61f3-a4a8-4460-af43-591369bfa6f3" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Finally, we give the final agent the main prompt and the list of tasks from task decomposition and that’s it!</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/5a0ff6b8-2c19-4ac9-8f93-283ab698ebc7" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="openbb-results">OpenBB Results<a href="#openbb-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OpenBB Results" title="Direct link to OpenBB Results">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prompt-a">Prompt A<a href="#prompt-a" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prompt A" title="Direct link to Prompt A">​</a></h3><p><em>"Check what are TSLA peers.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/8dfd85c1-c1c3-4d7b-bd38-ce777c8a8dd7" class="img_ev3q"></p><br><p>This blog post delves into how our collaboration with MindsDB, Nixtla, LlamaIndex, and Langchain is revolutionizing the financial world. Read on to learn all about the event "The New FinAI Tech Stack" held last week in SF, California.</p><div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="context">Context<a href="#context" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Context" title="Direct link to Context">​</a></h2><p>In early September, I attended a “Future of Finance” event in NYC. Despite the presence of well-known financial professionals from top firms in the industry, I found the event lacked practical applications demonstrating how AI is impacting the financial sector.</p><p>Once I was back in the Bay Area, I had a barbecue with Jorge and Max from MindsDB and Nixtla, and I was commenting on that experience. To which Jorge promptly replied - why don’t we do it ourselves? So following this discussion, we decided to put the AI in finance event in motion.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/4c44a976-1257-4ace-b874-a6dc2f98e82f" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At OpenBB, AI has become a key component in our approach to refactoring the OpenBB Platform from the ground up. We've recently recruited a Head of AI to help us build our strategy and work on this effort full-time.</p><p>You can find more details on this <a href="/blog/revolutionizing-ai-at-openbb-with-new-leader-michael-struwig">here</a>.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/4bff3f1f-51a0-43a8-acff-2464fe3e9e0b" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="openbb-x-mindsdb">OpenBB x MindsDB<a href="#openbb-x-mindsdb" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OpenBB x MindsDB" title="Direct link to OpenBB x MindsDB">​</a></h2><p>A few days later, I visited the MindsDB office to discuss collaborating with Jorge on potential partnerships. I suggested the idea of gaining access to MindsDB's data, a proposal that seemed feasible to implement.</p><p>Eventually, we accomplished this, and I even showcased it during the event last week. The code for this endeavour is open source. Take a look <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/backend-for-terminal-pro/tree/main/mindsdb_python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/bbc1b3c9-2617-46a1-aae6-f41cfd4d3745"></video><p>However, Jorge had an even bigger idea. He proposed the concept of granting MindsDB users access to OpenBB data via SQL and harnessing MindsDB's capabilities for machine learning. Essentially, we could convert the data frame in runtime into a virtual SQL table, since we have access to the Pydantic model from the OpenBB platform, and we can build that on the go.</p><p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/didier_lopes/status/1710560436398264756?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeting about this</a>, I received numerous messages, which validated that there was interest in OBB SQL. So, we set off to work on this. Together with the OpenBB team, we made it easy to access all available inputs/outputs for each endpoint, while the MindsDB team worked on virtualizing the tables. The result can be seen <a href="https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/openbb_handler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>At the event last week, Jorge shared this work. Additionally, in collaboration with LangChain, he successfully developed a Slack bot with direct access to this data, all accessible within Slack</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="openbb-x-nixtla">OpenBB x Nixtla<a href="#openbb-x-nixtla" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OpenBB x Nixtla" title="Direct link to OpenBB x Nixtla">​</a></h2><p>Back in August, Nixtla introduced the initial foundation generative AI model for temporal data at MindsDB. At that time, we received an invitation to showcase the practical applications of TimeGPT in production, and for the first time, we unveiled Terminal Pro briefly.</p><p>I detailed this experience in a <a href="https://openbb.co/blog/openbb-incorporates-the-first-generative-AI-model-for-temporal-data-timegpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> and shared a similar demo during the event last week.</p><video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/a8a391c9-33e8-4c6b-821c-620617d4fe33"></video><p>Following that, Max and Azul from Nixtla proceeded to share a presentation where they used OpenBB data to assess price targets from analysts and develop an approach on how it is possible to reduce the bias inherent to price estimates and produce better estimates.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="openbb-x-llamaindex">OpenBB x LlamaIndex<a href="#openbb-x-llamaindex" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OpenBB x LlamaIndex" title="Direct link to OpenBB x LlamaIndex">​</a></h2><p>Back in July, we initiated the development of AskOBB, enabling users to interact with the open source <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenBB Terminal</a> using natural language. In this effort, we leveraged LlamaIndex and you can see more about it <a href="https://openbb.co/blog/breaking-barriers-with-openbb-and-llamaIndex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>So when we started discussing an AI in Finance event, it only made sense to reach out to Jerry and Simon to invite their team to present at the event. And so we did. Jerry ended up presenting their <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/sec-insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source SEC insights repo</a> that uses the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of LlamaIndex to answer questions about SEC 10-K &amp; 10-Q documents.</p><p>As for the OpenBB Terminal Pro, we demonstrated how we are using LlamaIndex to chat with documents that are uploaded to the OpenBB Terminal Pro. The video below highlights these features.</p><video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/3c4190be-2676-4790-a59e-c33c6006a195"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="openbb-x-langchain">OpenBB x Langchain<a href="#openbb-x-langchain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OpenBB x Langchain" title="Direct link to OpenBB x Langchain">​</a></h2><p>After attending the AI Engineering Summit event, specifically Harrison’s workshop on how to get started with agents using Langchain, I felt inspired to create an agent on top of the OpenBB platform.</p><p>So that very day, I went home and started to work on <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this repo</a>. By the end of the day, the agent was already able to perform complex queries.</p><p>Over time I iterated on it to make the agent more robust, but the improvement on the architecture started to happen after Michael joined OpenBB and he was able to focus on this full-time - the progress can be found on <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this open source repo</a>. An example of a prompt that the agent can answer is:</p><blockquote><p><em>Check what are TSLA peers. From those, check which one has the highest market cap. Then, on the ticker that has the highest market cap get the most recent price target estimate from an analyst, and tell me who it was and on what date the estimate was made.</em></p></blockquote><br><p>So at the event, Harrison presented this architecture which heavily relies on Langchain and OpenBB tools.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/my-website/assets/25267873/04d6b023-b6ab-4fe6-8d5c-4a071731611a" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Later on, I demonstrated how we can integrate this architecture into OpenBB Copilot and make it available from the OpenBB Terminal Pro.</p><video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/a3c20953-ca08-4bdd-b7d5-93878edc7e07"></video><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wrap-up">Wrap up<a href="#wrap-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wrap up" title="Direct link to Wrap up">​</a></h2><p>Finally, this was an amazing event organized by MindsDB and a team that put together 5 of the most prominent open-source companies working on problems at the intersection of AI and Finance.</p><p>You can rewatch the entire event here:</p><div class="flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1rYmWWVbIY?si=25HUWPxjAB8sfUPx" width="800" height="400"></iframe></div><br><p>We're considering organizing another event like this soon, possibly even in NYC.</p><p>And if your firm is interested in early access to the OpenBB Terminal Pro, you can reach out to <a href="mailto:hello@openbb.finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hello@openbb.finance</a>, we’d love to chat.</p>]]></content>
