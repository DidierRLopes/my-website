        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-12-27-ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will.png"></p>
<p>Why the future of financial analysis isn't about chatbots, but about intelligent workspaces that combine your data, tools, and AI exactly when you need them.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>When ChatGPT launched, everyone rushed to build financial chatbots. But they missed two fundamental truths:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best AI model is useless without access to your data.</li>
<li>Access to data isn't enough - AI needs to handle complete workflows, not just conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with financial chatbots:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can't access your proprietary data</li>
<li>They can't handle complex financial workflows</li>
<li>They force analysts to work in an unnatural chat interface</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Here's how OpenBB solves this:</p>
<p>First, we ensure complete data access:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run everything on-premise or in your VPC</li>
<li>Connect any data source: files, APIs, third-party feeds, anything</li>
<li>Use a universal data layer that standardizes everything (whether it's CSV, Excel, Snowflake, or APIs)</li>
</ul>
<p>But the real innovation?</p>
<p>We're building AI differently.</p>
<p>Instead of forcing analysts to chat with a bot, we're embedding intelligence directly into their workspace.</p>
<p>Think dashboards with widgets, not chat windows. Data visualization, not text conversations.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Kimberly Tan (partner @ a16z) predicted in <a href="https://a16z.com/big-ideas-in-tech-2025/">her analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Chat was the first experimental interface — now I expect there will be new, novel interaction mechanisms. In this phase, AI agents will be able to take direct action in the workflow, and the UI will be reimagined for humans to review work or do QA."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>The result?</p>
<p align="center"><img width="1200" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-12-27-why-chatgpt-alone-wont-revolutionize-finance.png"></p>
<p>A workspace where:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI appears only when needed (for insights, summaries, or generating visualizations)</li>
<li>Firms can adopt AI at their own pace</li>
<li>Analysts keep their familiar workflows while gaining AI superpowers</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me show you this in action.</p>
<p>Last week, I shared how <a href="https://x.com/mattmaximo1/status/1869413550210625818">Matt from VanEck</a> built a powerful dashboard integrating multiple distinct data sources on OpenBB. Post with comments can be found <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/didier-lopes_today-i-saw-a-glimpse-of-the-future-matt-activity-7275174801860636672-qoy4?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">here</a>.</p>
<p>I only showed a screenshot of this dashboard with data.</p>
<p>There was no sign of AI in it.</p>
<p>However, if I had simply pressed shortcut "Ctrl+L", the copilot window would have opened and I would have been able to natively interact with the data - and generate new data from it.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="1200" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-12-27-ai-chatbots-wont-revolutionize-finance-but-intelligent-workspaces-will_1.png"></p>
<p>This demonstrates that the future of financial AI isn't about chatbots - it's about intelligent workspaces.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/pyquantnews">Jason from PyQuantNews</a> astutely observes: <em>"OpenBB solves the data aggregation and centralization challenge without relying on AI, creating a ton of value from it. And then, you allow users to utilize AI in their workflows as they see fit."</em></p>
<p>This isn't just another AI product.</p>
<p>It's the future of financial analysis - where AI enhances your workspace instead of replacing it.</p>]]></content>

<p>This is how OpenBB is reaching users worldwide with Chrome's translation features, making financial analytics accessible in multiple languages and expanding our presence across 84% of countries since launch.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>Since our launch on October 7th, we realized that while the majority of our audience is based in the US - we have users utilizing OpenBB from all around the globe.</p>
<p>In fact, if we count sign ups since October we have a 84% country representation.</p>
<p>Today, most of the top financial firms have reached out to OpenBB to learn more. Either because they heard about us from others, or had someone internally speaking about OpenBB.</p>
<p>However - it has also happened having conversation with firms that focus so much on emerging markets (e.g. LatAm) that they speak mostly Portuguese or Spanish.</p>
<p>So, here I am showing you that you can utilize the Google Translate feature that comes with Google Chrome in under 10 seconds to have our product being translated in real-time to your language of choice.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-12-22-openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta_1.jpeg"></p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-12-22-openbb-and-our-global-reach-since-leaving-beta_2.jpeg"></p>
<p>I've been playing with it in Portuguese, and it works <em>surprisingly</em> well.</p>
<p>This even means that you can utilize your AI copilot in your language of choice, which is mind blowing!</p>
<p>It's this Christmas that I will be able to convert my family to DAU. 😃</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-12-20-why-ai-analysts-need-human-like-workspaces-not-just-chat-interfaces.jpeg"></p>
<p>Why I believe AI agents need the same comprehensive workspace tools as human analysts, moving beyond simple chat interfaces to enable true financial research and analytics.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>This week, Insight Partners published <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/ideas/state-of-the-ai-agent-ecosystem-use-cases-and-learnings-for-technology-builders-and-buyers/">"The state of the AI Agents ecosystem: The tech, use cases, and economics"</a> which mentions OpenBB on the map in terms of Financial Services AI agents.</p>
<p>I'd like to explain our flavor of AI analyst.</p>
<p>An AI agent is defined as "a program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals".</p>
<p>If I were to describe the role of an Analyst I could use that exact same sentence, except that I wouldn't use "program" but "human".</p>
<p>Yet most companies and products out there are focusing on the data and forgetting about the interface.</p>
<p>If the job to be done by an AI agent is the same as the human agent - why aren't we starting from the assumption that they need the same tools and interface as a human analyst would.</p>
<p>I mean, I don't see financial analysts spending their day doing analysis &amp; research on Slack or on a chat-only interface.</p>
<p>This is where we differ and where we decided to take the longer path in doing what's right.</p>
<p>No shortcuts.</p>
<p>Yes, our AI agent (or the one our users bring) has access to their own data.</p>
<p>But more importantly, it is interconnected with a workspace, effectively having the same type of capabilities that an analyst would so it can truly perform research and analytics.</p>
<p>The goal is actually straightforward:</p>
<p>The AI agent should be able to do anything and everything that a user can with a mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extracting insights from multiple datasets</li>
<li>Adding a particular widget to a dashboard</li>
<li>Creating a dashboard from scratch based on data available</li>
<li>Run a particular prediction model with pre-define parameters</li>
<li>Collaborating on a dashboard with a colleague</li>
<li>Having access to the internet to add research notes to the dashboard</li>
<li>Join datasets efficiently</li>
<li>Write SQL queries to extract particular data from a data warehouse</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>Agree or disagree?</p>]]></content>

<p>My friend Matt, from VanEck, built a backend with data from Coingecko, Velodata, Artemis, CCdata, Glassnode, MSTR Tracker, Telegram and Google - all in OpenBB.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p><a href="https://x.com/mattmaximo1">Matt Maximo</a> has been building a backend with data from Coingecko, Velodata, Artemis, CCdata, Glassnode, MSTR Tracker, Telegram and Google.</p>
<p>However, he didn't find the best product where he could:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bring all this data into one interface</li>
<li>Leverage an intelligence layer on top</li>
<li>Collaborate with his team on it</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Until he did.</p>
<p>With our free tier - Matt was able to single-handedly create almost 50 different data widgets that he (and his team) will be able to access seamlessly on OpenBB.</p>
<p>As we shift to firms being more in control of their data, and with the clear gains from having an additional intelligence layer on top of that data - the need for OpenBB in the market has never been clearer.</p>
<p>Shifting the control back to financial firms.</p>
<p>More open. More adaptable.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My thoughts on how removing PIPs can increase the company talent level]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-11-09-why-we-got-rid-of-pips-at-openbb.png"></p>
<p>At OpenBB, we removed Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) in an attempt to increase the company's talent density pool rate.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h2>
<p>We are currently 16 FTE and since the company started 3 years ago, we’ve let go 15 people.</p>
<p>This means we’re letting go of more than 1 person a quarter since the start of OpenBB.</p>
<p>Most people had a 3-week PIP process before their departures. But out of the 15 PIPs done, only one was successful. All the others have resulted in a contract termination.</p>
<p>That’s a success rate of less than 7%, which is extremely low.</p>
<h3 id="statistics">Statistics</h3>
<p>If we go into the machine learning domain and have a model that predicts that a team member who gets into a PIP is let go every time - this is the classification matrix that we would have.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-11-09-why-we-got-rid-of-pips-at-openbb_02.png"></p>
<p>Which has:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>93.3% precision - answers: of all the people predicted to be let go (15), how many were let go? (14)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% recall - answers: of all the people that were let go (14), how many were predicted correctly (14)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, this isn’t the full story.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of a physics book treating an object as a point mass, considering the body as perfectly rigid or assuming the system is isolated with no external forces.</p>
<p>So what are the other things to consider? Let’s separate these time-wise:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before a PIP happens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the PIP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the PIP</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="before-a-pip">Before a PIP</h2>
<p>Before someone starts a PIP, their performance has already been subpar.</p>
<p>By definition, performance is a lagging indicator, which means you are already late when you catch this person not pulling as much value as others.</p>
<p>Particularly when you consider that the person who would be initiating the PIP is the team lead (TL)/manager and isn’t working as closely with this person as others on a daily basis. Hence, coworkers are likely to see firsthand this suboptimal performance in advance of the team lead or manager.</p>
<p>So, the suboptimal performance from this person over a few days or weeks is likely to go unnoticed and slow down the company.</p>
<p>In addition, individual contributors (ICs) who work closely with this person are likely to notice this before the TL/manager, thus impacting their motivation.</p>
<p><em><strong>"If this person can get the same compensation as I do for average work, why am I putting in so much time and effort?"</strong></em></p>
<p>Honestly, if there’s one thing that I’ve learned, it’s that A players get motivated by other A players (“A players attract A players”).</p>
<h2 id="during-a-pip">During a PIP</h2>
<p>A PIP takes time. <strong>A LOT of it.</strong></p>
<p>And that’s the one thing that startups don’t have.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have the following org:</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-11-09-why-we-got-rid-of-pips-at-openbb_03.png"></p>
<p>If an IC is underperforming, the TL will discuss it with the IC in advance.</p>
<p>Then the team lead may ask for feedback from other ICs who work with the IC in question.</p>
<p>After that, the TL will talk with the Director about this before initiating the PIP.</p>
<p>Then the Director will mention this to the CEO of the company.</p>
<p>The CEO will likely want to talk with the team lead about this, given that in an organization of 15 people, each team member accounts for more than 5% of the org.</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking, “But this happens before the PIP”.</p>
<p>This happens before and continues throughout the entire PIP. But, during the PIP, it’s even worse because there are regular meetings for a shorter feedback loop, and there needs to be documentation on the progress.</p>
<p>So yes, this not only takes a lot of time, but it’s also a distraction to the team.</p>
<p>And that’s the other thing that companies need: “focus”.</p>
<p>You can’t fully focus at 100% when you know that someone is “fighting” for their job. And not being able to focus impacts each individual’s performance.</p>
<p>So this inefficiency ends up spreading across the team.</p>
<h2 id="after-the-pip">After the PIP</h2>
<h3 id="needs-to-be-let-go">Needs to be let go</h3>
<p>Ok, someone was underperforming and needs to be let go.</p>
<p>The company needs to figure out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How many options this person has vested and handle the paperwork if they want to buy them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether they have company equipment that needs to be returned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What the severance package will be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to handle the news and how the team will react</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this will be a distraction for at least an additional week and will affect other team members, who may be surprised by this.</p>
<p>Particularly because, most of the time, they aren’t aware that the PIP is happening and from their perspective, someone they liked to work with was let go.</p>
<h3 id="has-a-successful-pip">Has a successful PIP</h3>
<p>Let’s be honest, these cases are very rare.</p>
<p>Not just at OpenBB. I’ve spoken with other founders, and this is the same feedback I’ve received.</p>
<p>But let’s ignore that, we already mentioned it at the start.</p>
<p>Someone on a PIP—almost by definition—isn’t a high performer. They could be a high performer in some parts of the job, but not as a whole. However, this is the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>The rule, often, is that this person has been doing just enough to be competent at the company—but not excel. Then, over a period of time, due to internal reasons, lack of motivation, etc., they fall below that threshold.</p>
<p>This means that even after a successful PIP, you are putting all of these resources toward getting—not a high performer, but a B+ player.</p>
<p>And ultimately, this is why we are getting rid of the PIP at OpenBB.</p>
<p>Being <strong>“good enough”</strong> isn’t the culture we want for OpenBB and doesn’t represent our team today. If you let the bar slip, you won’t even realize it until it’s too late.</p>
<p>Again, performance is a lagging indicator and can have both positive and negative effects on the team—so it’s important to protect the team from poor performers.</p>
<p>There are two exceptions to this:</p>
<p><strong>1. Imagine that this person can turn their output into 4x, imagine they had a wake-up call.</strong></p>
<p>Several questions need to be asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If this person can perform at this level, why weren't they doing it before?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long will they maintain this level of performance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will we need to have another serious conversation to get this person to reach this level of competency again at a later stage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will they always resent the company because of the PIP?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It all boils down to this: if this person isn’t motivated by what we’re building, regardless of their skill set, they weren’t a good fit in the first place.</p>
<p>We’re fortunate to have a pipeline of people applying for positions at OpenBB, not just for the money but for the product and the mission of the company.</p>
<p><strong>2. The person is a high performer but has been performing poorly in some areas of the job (e.g. communications, testing, documentation, …)</strong></p>
<p>This person had likely received feedback multiple times, but the PIP made it more real: <em>“This is what we are looking for in a person for your role; you have 2-3 weeks to prove that you can double down on your weaknesses and reach the level the team needs you to be at.”</em></p>
<p>This is what happened to us, and the person improved significantly, so much so that they are now a core part of who OpenBB is today.</p>
<p>This success story was one of the main reasons we continued doing PIPs.</p>
<p>But the likelihood of it happening again is so low that it’s not worth keeping PIP to look for another success story like this one.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h2>
<h3 id="how-we-think-about-talent-level-at-openbb">How we think about talent level at OpenBB</h3>
<p>Let’s say you define company’s talent value as the sum of the talent of each individual divided by the total number of team members.</p>
<p>There are two ways to increase this value:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hire people who are above OpenBB’s talent level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let go of people who fall below the talent level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, ideally, do both.</p>
<p>The problem is that for the first option, you often need <strong>a LOT</strong> of capital.</p>
<p>For the second, you don’t. Not only that but letting go of low performers will accomplish two things simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increase OpenBB’s talent level immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free up resources that can be invested in someone above OpenBB’s current talent value (assuming that companies should always seek high performers and avoid settling for underperformers).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s why removing PIPs leads to an increase in the company’s talent level. You’re not just increasing the talent level once, but likely twice.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Imagine we have 5 people at OpenBB with talent scores of 2, 7, 7, 7, and 9. Then OpenBB’s talent level is:</p>
<p>(2+7+7+7+9)/5 = 6.4</p>
<p>If we let go of the employee with a talent score of 2, our talent level becomes 7.4. Then, if we bring in someone with a score of 8 using the same resources, that talent level increases to 7.6.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<h3 id="what-the-team-can-expect">What the team can expect?</h3>
<p>Full transparency.</p>
<p>We want to build a culture where feedback is an ever-present element, and we don’t need to wait for performance reviews to give feedback that can substantially improve team performance and push the company forward.</p>
<p>In fact, not sharing this feedback puts the company in a worse position, and it is your duty to share it. But do so with candor, in a constructive manner that keeps the team member motivated.</p>
<p>However, each team member must care. This means you can’t rely solely on your team lead to give you feedback every day—you need to ask for it regularly. That’s the best way for you to grow.</p>
<h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2>
<p>We made this decision after reading <em>No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention</em>, where they also removed PIPs.</p>
<p>Unlike Netflix, we don’t have the resources to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pay top of the market</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer a generous severance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We still pay good salaries, just not enough to compete with public companies. This means we need to spend much more time finding diamonds in the rough.</p>
<p>And that’s why we have a higher turnover; finding diamonds in the rough is much riskier.</p>
<p>In any case, I think optimizing to pay top of the market is misguided—at least for startups—as it incentivizes the wrong type of talent.</p>
<p>It incentivizes mercenaries instead of missionaries.</p>
<p>At an early stage, you need people who want a lot of ownership and autonomy, who are excited to work with a team and on a product they believe in, and who have a chip on their shoulders.</p>
<p>Regardless of the startup, I have yet to see someone with this mentality who doesn’t end up being successful.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Most of the people who were let go would be considered good employees in most companies today, and they had strong referrals. But companies have different types of needs that evolve over time, and as founders, it’s our role to look at the company as a whole and understand what it needs at the moment and, more importantly, what it will need in the coming months and years.</p>]]></content>

<p>Maximizing team transparency through focused feedback sessions.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>A couple of months ago, my co-founder came to NYC for our board meeting.</p>
<p>During that week, we took a day to sync up with everyone on the team—literally. We had 14 conversations, each lasting up to 30 minutes. Apart from lunch, we did all these back-to-back.</p>
<p>The goal of this exercise was 2-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check up on the team. Basically, a more in-depth version of:
<a href="https://openbb.co/company/open/team">https://openbb.co/company/open/team</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the team share anything they want with leadership or ask any questions openly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-25-implement-feedback-loops-everywhere-you-can_2.jpeg"></p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<h3 id="part-1---20-minutes">Part 1 - 20 minutes</h3>
<p>For the first 20 minutes, we asked the following questions to each team member:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How do you feel working for OpenBB today?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you enjoy the most about working at this company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who do you get along the best? and why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who do you feel like you have a not-so-close relationship with? and why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does your day-to-day look like?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you describe the relationship with your manager/team lead?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's 2028 and OpenBB didn't make it. What are potential reasons that you would bet on that lead to this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you had to tell us what your biggest achievement is since being in the company, which one would you pick?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was your lowest moment during company time - and why? What could we have done better?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(for managers/team leads) How do you feel about the team you have today?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="part-2---10-minutes">Part 2 - 10 minutes</h3>
<p>During the last 10 minutes, the team could ask us about anything.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, we learned just as much (if not more) from the questions the team asked than the ones from Part 1.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Lack of focus is the biggest risk/challenge that we face as a company.</p>
<h3 id="culture">Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Handbook is important (folks didn't know about personal development budget, PIP, etc…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The team's main reasons for being happy at OpenBB are autonomy, ownership, smart team, transparency and freedom - very aligned with our values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remote work is a benefit that more people should take advantage of. Celebrate it even more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's vital to set boundaries when overworking and know when to decompress to avoid burnout</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="management">Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's key to consider that each person has different preferences in terms of management style - execution vs contributing to discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:1s are essential and everyone should have them set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:1s should be focused on the direct report and not necessarily on tasks at hand. Several people highlighted that they felt that their manager cared about them based on conversations about their personal life and personal development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feedback should go both ways, the manager/leader appreciates when feedback is provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting up expectations clearly for each individual is critical. People appreciate when they know exactly what is expected of them, so they understand how their value is perceived from the company's perspective.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rituals">Rituals</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monthly update emails are very good. Sometimes even more details would be better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people are so focused on execution that they try to protect their time at all costs. It's important to respect this decision and default to async text-based conversations instead of setting up a meeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dogfood the product from people from different backgrounds is important as it gives different points of view that we can leverage to make our product better</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="communicatiions">Communicatiions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be aware of different comms styles throughout org. In general, people have shared that they appreciate when others send them a DM with feedback based on a conversation in a public channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes team members need to put themselves in the shoes of other people first instead of defaulting to defence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shouldn't compromise on quality. We should aim to agree first on the best solution and then adapt if there's a lack of resources, but knowing what the best solution is and what is the trade-off that is being made</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a conversation is taking a few messages back and forth, sometimes a quick huddle should be done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sure that all stakeholders are involved regarding features or changes in the product before any green light is given to execute. It happened that a green light was given, mockups were created based on that context and the engineering team added the feature. Only for that to get pushed back because a stakeholder that wasn't involved in the discussion saw the final result on Slack chat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More transparency when deals are closed - e.g. what are they interested in, how many seats, what do they do on a day-to-day basis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When mentioning increased transparency, the vast majority of people think that our level of transparency is very high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A common answer: "If I have any questions I know can just DM you and you will answer"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a Q&amp;A at the end of the status update where everyone can put questions to be answered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A common answer: "I don't like when someone leaves out of a sudden". Unfortunately, we can't do anything here. We've also asked for feedback on what we could do better, but people understood that there's not much we can do. This is a conversation between the person and the manager and it's unfair for the person being let go if we share their personal information. There's a PIP and that means that before everyone leaves the company they are in 3-4 weeks PIP, where expectations are set clearly and their continuity depends on their output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People appreciate feedback a lot, regardless of if it's positive or not. It's the best way for them to improve.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>I think, at an early stage, everyone should do this. And maybe even at a later stage but in each subset of the org.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I think this worked so well is that for the first 20 minutes, you are asking the exact same questions to everyone and so that allows you to get answers that you can compare across the board.</p>
<p>Then, once those 20 minutes are over, the team member feels that they have already been so transparent that they openly ask questions that they are curious about.</p>
<p>The final result was a presentation with all the combined learnings and actionable.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon.png"></p>
<p>How we built a mobile app, in 1 evening, with 1 engineer.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>Let’s start with a bit of background to this story. 📖</p>
<p>Back in September 2021, our first full-time team member was <a href="https://x.com/josedonato__?utm_source=didierlopes.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon">Jose Donato</a>. He started full-time, even before I did (due to my 3 months notice period in Europe, yikes).</p>
<p>We met through Reddit, only to discover that we are both Portuguese and our hometowns aren’t far from each other.</p>
<p>I’ve learned more from him about web development than from any YouTube, tutorial or book - combined.</p>
<p>One of the topics he was very passionate about, was the concept of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). So much so, that he talked about it in his thesis (<a href="https://jose-donato.deno.dev/master_thesis.pdf?utm_source=didierlopes.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon">2.2 native applications</a>).</p>
<p>I had never heard of it before, but the concept intrigued me. Why wouldn’t more companies do that?</p>
<p>Jose is currently writing a post about it, you can subscribe to the <a href="https://openbb.co/newsletter?utm_source=didierlopes.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon">company newsletter</a> to keep an eye out for it.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-compatibility">Mobile compatibility</h2>
<p>Fast forward to September 3rd, 2024. 🏃‍♂️</p>
<p>We are 1 week away from one of the biggest launches in the company. Earlier surprise for my subscribers, but we are about to announce a free version of our enterprise product.</p>
<p>A web app that allows users to bring any type of data and have access to an agent to interact with all these different datasets to extract patterns, trends and insights.</p>
<p>This web app has been built over 2 years and all workflows, tests, and iterations have been done for desktop usage.</p>
<p>Jose sent me a video of a mobile version somewhat polished. It had the same UX as the terminal, but it rendered nicely on mobile.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_2.png"></p>
<p>Given that we were aiming at adoption, he believed it was important for users to be able to access the terminal through their phones on the web.</p>
<p>And so over 2 weeks, he spent no more than 3h polishing the mobile version.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-ux">Mobile UX</h2>
<p>On the 23rd of September, I pinged <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-rita-soares-48b247152/?utm_source=didierlopes.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon">Rita Soares</a> - our lead UI/UX.</p>
<p>I had been thinking about mobile user experience and wasn’t happy that we just adapted the interface to work with mobile. But, mobile represents a completely different paradigm on how we use a product. The screen space, the speed at which you can type, not necessarily used for work, more distractions, etc…</p>
<p>So, I asked Rita to create a few mobile mockups for me - the idea was to improve the UX to make the copilot shine. I.e. more front and center and have the data visualization pushed more to the background.</p>
<p>That same evening, she shared these mockups with me:</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_3.png"></p>
<p>I promptly shared in a group with her and Jose - this was 7:35 pm my time, which would be 0:35 am their time.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_4.png"></p>
<p>In less than 24 hours the bulk of the mockups had been implemented.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_5.png"></p>
<h3 id="progressive-web-apps-pwas">Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h3>
<p>On that same day, after Jose shared the bulk of mockups implemented.</p>
<p>I sent him this message at 8:55 pm EST (1:55 am Portugal time for Jose).</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_7.png"></p>
<p>To which he replied:</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_8.png"></p>
<p>I was right, it didn’t take him 30s. But it didn’t take him much longer (15 minutes).</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_9.png"></p>
<p>15 minutes to have OpenBB as an application on my phone.</p>
<p>I was mind-blown.</p>
<p>We iterated on it for an additional 1h30m together, until we had something we would be proud to share with the team the following day.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="300" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-10-05-openbb-mobile-app-coming-soon_10.png"></p>
<p>We still had to iterate on a few more areas and involve more people from the team. But the bulk of the mobile app was done.</p>
<p>In pretty much 1 evening.</p>
<p>With 1 person.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I could tell you that this doesn’t happen often, but it does.</p>
<p>Small, highly motivated teams (or individuals like Jose) with a strong initiative and a drive to make a difference, can have a tremendous impact on the company.</p>
<p>I hope this post inspires more builders to share behind the scenes on how great products/features are built and how serendipity can play a role in it.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance.jpg"></p>
<p>I took the stage at the Cornell Quant Conference alongside Yu Yu (BlackRock) Tony Berkman (Two Sigma), and Samson Qian (Citadel), to discuss ChatGPT &amp; The Future of AI in Finance.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>Last week, I participated in a panel at the Cornell Financial Engineering Manhattan Conference. The topic of the panel was ‘ChatGPT &amp; The Future of AI in Finance.’</p>
<p>The other panelists were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yu Yu</strong>, Director of Data Science - BlackRock</li>
<li><strong>Tony Berkman</strong>, Managing Director - Two Sigma</li>
<li><strong>Samson Qian</strong>, Trader - Citadel</li>
</ul>
<p>After the discussion, several people reached out, mentioning it was one of their favorite panels of the day.</p>
<p>Since this wasn't recorded, I took the opportunity to write down some of the topics discussed, along with a few additional thoughts that I believe in.</p>
<p>I will organize the following sections based on the topics discussed at the event:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
<li>Agents are the future</li>
<li>When does it make sense to fine-tune?</li>
<li>Compliance and Data security</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-hallucinations">1. Hallucinations</h2>
<p>When talking about the topic of hallucinations, I have a <a href="https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1675630822093918209">quote</a> that I love from Marc Andreesen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hallucination is what we call when we don't like it. Creativity is what we call it when we do like it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="confident-hallucinations">Confident hallucinations</h3>
<p>The fundamental issue with hallucinations is the fact that the model hallucinates with confidence.</p>
<p>Imagine asking two different friends: “Do you know where location X is?”</p>
<p><strong>Friend A</strong>: It’s there.</p>
<p><strong>Friend B</strong>: Hmm, I’m not really sure. If I had to guess, I’d say there, but I’m not 100% certain.</p>
<p>If both gave wrong directions, you would consider <strong>Friend A</strong> a liar, but not Friend B. This is because <strong>Friend B</strong> lacked confidence in their answer, they were trying to help but highlighted that they weren’t sure about it.</p>
<p>The problem with current LLMs is that they are, for the most part, like <strong>Friend A</strong>. They say wrong things with certainty.</p>
<p>Hallucinations would be less problematic if the default behavior were more like the answer on the right, when the LLM is not 100% confident.</p>
<div class="flex justify-center items-center"><img width="350" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_1.png" style="margin-right:10px"><img width="350" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_2.png"></div>
<br>
<p>The problem with confident hallucinations is that, similar to why everyone dislikes liars, it leads to a lack of trust. So users begin to put everything that is output by an LLM under a microscope - even if what the model says is accurate.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-avoid-hallucinations">How to avoid hallucinations</h3>
<p>There are ways to address this and one of the key approaches we are extremely strong about at OpenBB is always tapping into information that is available.</p>
<p>When a user asks a question that requires financial data, the OpenBB Copilot always searches for that data on OpenBB (either through data we make available or through private data that customers bring).</p>
<p>The Copilot will only answer the question if that data exists. This allows the model to cite the data used in its response, so the user can double-check.</p>
<p>This is how it looks.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_3.png"></p>
<p>While I've heard a few vendors promising 100% accuracy, this is simply not true.</p>
<p>We are at a stage where technology is not even yet at the ‘trust but verify’ level.</p>
<p>So instead of hallucinating with confidence, when data is unavailable, we prompt the model to return that there was no real-time information accessible to answer the query.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_4.png"></p>
<h3 id="function-calling-to-increase-accuracy">Function calling to increase accuracy</h3>
<p>One thing we found that significantly reduces hallucinations is enabling our agent, OpenBB Copilot, to have access to all the API backends that users have through OpenBB or those they've added themselves.</p>
<p>Here’s the sequence of actions that happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user asks the OpenBB Copilot a question.</li>
<li>The prompt is converted into embeddings.</li>
<li>We compare that embedding with all the ones that we have on an OpenBB vector store which contains widget signatures - name, description, category, subcategory and source.</li>
<li>We retrieve the widgets with the highest similarity.</li>
<li>The Copilot then decides which widget to use based on the prompt.</li>
<li>Then Copilot also decides what parameters to use when calling that API</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>This leads to less hallucination because the LLM isn't outputting tokens based on a prompt and its internal weights. Instead, it's using its internal weights, the prompt, and a function call.</p>
<p>Assuming the function call succeeds - with correct widget retrieval and parameters - the data becomes available for the Copilot to use, which leads to higher accuracy.</p>
<p>Note: This still means that Copilot needs to use the correct widget and the correct parameter, but there's a <strong>higher likelihood of success</strong> because if it isn't, the API call will fail, prompting the LLM to try again.</p>
<p>Here's how it works behind the scenes, the OpenBB Copilot highlights its step-by-step reasoning so users can understand its thought process. Transparency is key.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_5.png"></p>
<h3 id="workflows-to-avoid-hallucinations">Workflows to avoid hallucinations</h3>
<p>In order to reduce the number of hallucinations, there are two things that can be done.</p>
<h4 id="enable-users-to-quickly-detect-whether-a-hallucination-has-occurred">Enable users to quickly detect whether a hallucination has occurred</h4>
<p>For instance, if a user utilizes the following prompt on the OpenBB Copilot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Using&nbsp;the&nbsp;earnings&nbsp;transcript,&nbsp;create&nbsp;a&nbsp;table&nbsp;with&nbsp;columns:&nbsp;financial&nbsp;metric,&nbsp;value,&nbsp;sentence&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;earnings&nbsp;where&nbsp;it&nbsp;was&nbsp;extracted&nbsp;from.&nbsp;Double&nbsp;check&nbsp;whether&nbsp;the&nbsp;information&nbsp;you&nbsp;are&nbsp;using&nbsp;is&nbsp;correct.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>They get the "<em>Sentence Extracted From</em>" column, which they can copy and paste into a search field added at the top of the Earnings Transcript widget. This enable users to quickly validate the numbers that have been found.</p>
<p>See example below,</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_6.png"></p>
<h4 id="add-deterministic-processes-to-check-for-hallucinations">Add deterministic processes to check for hallucinations</h4>
<p>For example, let’s say the user prompt involves a data retrieval task.</p>
<p>We can run a deterministic process to check whether the retrieved values exist or not. Sure this won't be 100% accurate because the numbers could be flagged by referring to another thing, BUT it's all about improving the overall accuracy of Copilot.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whatever can be done to improve the Copilot’s accuracy should be done.</p>
<h2 id="2-agents-are-the-future">2. Agents are the future</h2>
<p>When we think about how humans operate, we recognize that the brain coordinates all the actions of our body and our thought processes. This is similar to how agents work.</p>
<p>If I'm playing soccer, the muscles I use are different from those I would use if I were boxing. If I'm programming, the parts of my brain I use differ from those I would use when listening to music.</p>
<p>However, it's not as simple as "activity A requires legs". Most of your body and mind are always involved, but at different times and in different capacities. And what dictates that are external factors.</p>
<p>For instance, if I am playing soccer as a winger and my team is attacking, I will likely be using both legs to run forward and a lot of mental energy to decide where to position myself on the field.</p>
<p>And that will change a lot based on where the ball is. If the ball is on the opposite side, I'll likely run less and stay more in the middle to be ready for a counterattack. If the ball is in the middle, I'll probably be running at full speed to create space. If the ball is close to me I have to worry more about controlling it and understand what I can do with it next.</p>
<p>The environment affects my plan to carry out an action where I want to have a successful outcome.</p>
<p><strong>This is how agents work.</strong></p>
<p>Agents aren't just about a single LLM performing well, but about a full workflow that interacts with multiple language models, function calls, or any other process to carry an action.</p>
<p>At the core, the biggest advantage of an agent over a LLM is that an agent has a full feedback loop. It understands the impact of the LLM output and can use that data in the next step of the process. Whereas a single LLM API call returns its best output but won't know how that affected the external environment.</p>
<p>This is why, at OpenBB, we believe in compound AI systems.</p>
<p>And apparently, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sequoia-sees-bigger-money-ai-203655254.html?guccounter=1">so does Sequoia</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-strawberry-issue-will-be-solved">The “Strawberry” issue will be solved</h3>
<p>A panelist commented on stage that LLMs can’t even count how many R's are in the word "Strawberry".</p>
<p>This <a href="https://x.com/MwangoCapital/status/1828857579860095428">tweet</a> offers a good explanation of why this happens — it turns out it's due to the tokenizer, and it can be solved. In fact, it's solved by simply ensuring that the model takes each letter as a token. See below,</p>
<div class="flex justify-center items-center"><img width="300" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_8.png" style="margin-right:10px"><img width="300" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_9.png"></div>
<br>
<p>This means that the model's output can be improved by doing extra work at the input level.</p>
<p>Data cleaning and pre-processing strikes again? 😃</p>
<p>Interestingly, a few days ago, <a href="https://openai.com/o1/">OpenAI announced OpenAI o1</a>. Which is basically GPT-4o with Chain-of-Thought (COT). This means that this model is a "wannabe agent".</p>
<p>It takes in a prompt from the user and decomposes it in natural steps to solve it. Then at each step, it takes the output of the model from the previous step and predicts the next token. It turns out that this improves accuracy substantially.</p>
<p>However, it still doesn’t have access to external data. And that is why I call it a "wannabe agent".</p>
<p>I love how Jeremiah put it in this <a href="https://x.com/jlowin/status/1834722014839418962">tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(...) Agents are also characterized by iterative behavior. But there's a key difference: while models like o1 iterate internally to refine their reasoning, agents engage in iterative interactions with the external world. They perceive the environment, take actions, observe the outcomes (or side effects) and adjust accordingly. This recursive process enables agents to handle tasks that require adaptability and responsiveness to real-world changes. (...)</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>So, o1's model isn't an agent - but it can solve this problem. The reason is that it applies its own data cleaning/pre-processing step on its own, and doesn't rely on external factors.</p>
<h3 id="small-language-models">Small Language Models</h3>
<p>Once agents work, Small Language Models (SLM) will be much more viable for very specific use cases.</p>
<p>In logical terms, a Large Language Model is a model with weights.</p>
<p>Large means that it has a lot of them. But what tends to happen is LLMs need to be very big because they want these models to be really good at everything. The problem is that if you want the exact same model to be good at discussing soccer, programming, and speaking Portuguese, its weights are updated using these drastically different datasets. Now the premise is that the more weights there are, the less each weight will be affected by data from completely different domains.</p>
<p>What a big LLM like GPT-4o is doing is trying to build a single Jarvis that knows about everything. Whereas we could have an SLM that does something extremely well and just focus on that, e.g. translating from English to Portuguese. The benefit of an SLM is that inference is likely faster, can be hosted on devices, and, in theory, it's better on a topic because it's been less "contaminated" during training by data that doesn't relate to the task at hand.</p>
<p>Imagine that a firm decides to use an SLM trained to retrieve data from SEC filings quickly and at scale. Or, we could train our own SLM to understand user intent and interact directly with the OpenBB Terminal interface.</p>
<h3 id="large-language-models-as-orchestrator">Large Language Models as orchestrator</h3>
<p>In my opinion, the best LLM in each category will win. And the second and third won't matter. It's a winner-takes-all kind of market. Unless in specific verticals such as inference time or open weights (e.g. for data security; more on this later).</p>
<p>The best example of this is OpenAI vs Anthropic.</p>
<p>I had been using OpenAI's GPT-4 for coding for several months. After trying Anthropic's Sonnet 3.5 for coding, I never went back to OpenAI.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="400" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_10.png"></p>
<p>The market share for the best LLM will be gigantic. That’s why <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-11/openai-fundraising-set-to-vault-startup-s-value-to-150-billion">OpenAI is looking to raise at a $150 billion valuation</a>. While the valuation reflects the market size, the amount that will be raised represents the capital needed to reach that valuation. This is why only a few players will be able to compete at that level.</p>
<p>In an "agentic future", I believe the best LLM will serve as the core "brain" - the main LLM that routes all prompts and decides what happens next.</p>
<p>And who wouldn't want the smartest model controlling the actions with a list of models, functions and data at its disposal?</p>
<p>I know I would.</p>
<p>That's also why, when discussing OpenBB Copilot, we don’t rely on a single foundational model. Instead, we use the models that are best suited for each specific task.</p>
<p>For instance, OpenAI o1 can be the brains, but when a user uses @web it triggers the Perplexity model, and when they upload an image, we have Anthropic's Haiku. Or maybe if they want to do intraday trading, we use Llama 3.1 through Groq for fast inference.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<h2 id="3-when-does-it-make-sense-to-fine-tune">3. When does it make sense to fine-tune</h2>
<p>A good comment was made on the panel: "<em>it’s expensive to spend time fine-tuning a new model, just for that entire work to be 'eradicated' by a new model that has a higher performance in that specific domain than the model has been fine-tuned</em>".</p>
<p>In my opinion, this happens because the timing isn't right yet. We are still unlocking remarkable achievements through each new model release. Although there is a massive bump in terms of capability between these releases, I wouldn't recommend that a firm fine-tune its own models at this stage.</p>
<p>However, at some point, whether due to a lack of data to train or architecture needing to be reinvented, improvements in LLM performance won't be substantial - they may not even be noticeable. This is when the fine-tuning technique becomes relevant because at this stage you are trying to repurpose everything the model has towards a specific vertical / use-case - and at that vertical/use-case that model will be better than the following one.</p>
<p>Then after some new models come out, you may consider reapplying fine-tuning to that model, but this would likely be years later, not weeks or months. So, the ROI can be quite high. Particularly when you are trying to win in your specific market.</p>
<p>This is how I see it working in my head:</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_11.png"></p>
<h2 id="4-compliance-and-data-security">4. Compliance and Data security</h2>
<p>Another question I received was about compliance and data security.</p>
<p>Recently, during a discussion with one of the largest hedge funds in the world, we were asked about the entire workflow of the data when our AI Copilot has access to it.</p>
<p>Their main concern was ensuring that no data was being shared with third-party vendors like OpenAI. For such firms, their data is their alpha, and keeping it within their network is paramount.</p>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts often say, "Not your keys, not your coins" to emphasize the importance of storing assets in a cold wallet rather than leaving them on an exchange that might implode (looking at you, FTX). The same principle applies here: "Not your weights, not your data".</p>
<p>When you send information to a large foundation model provider like OpenAI, your data enters their ecosystem, and you have to trust they’ll honor the terms of your contract.</p>
<p>A more secure approach is to host an open-source model locally within your firm, ensuring that sensitive data remains entirely within your infrastructure and network.</p>
<p>Although open-source models aren’t yet as powerful as closed-source ones, they are catching up quickly. If you think that GPT-4o can already do a lot for you, think about how at some point there will be an open-source model that is GPT-4o equivalent. Sure, at that time closed-source models will be better, but the question is: How much better?</p>
<p>Or better, the question is: <strong>"How much are you willing to sacrifice in terms of data security for performance?”</strong>.</p>
<p>At OpenBB, we take this very seriously and have taken measures to allow enterprise customers to fully control their data.</p>
<h3 id="bring-your-own-copilot">Bring your own copilot</h3>
<p>Enable firms to bring their own LLMs to access data within OpenBB. This means that we provide an interface for research, but also allow them to integrate their internal LLMs and interact directly with it from OpenBB.</p>
<div class="flex justify-center items-center"><img width="350" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_12.png" style="margin-right:10px"><img width="350" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_13.png"></div>
<br>
<p>We believe in this idea so much, that we have open-source the architecture for firms to bring their own Copilot to OpenBB. More information is available <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/copilot-for-terminal-pro/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="turn-off-ai-workflows">Turn off AI workflows</h3>
<p>We have incorporated workflows that make users' lives MUCH better. But they come at a cost: sharing data with an LLM provider.</p>
<p>These are the features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Widget title/description suggestion from Copilot</strong>: This sends the content of the table or note output by Copilot to an LLM provider to receive suggestions of a title and description.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_14.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Widget title/description suggestion upon upload</strong>: It sends the content of the file that has been uploaded to an LLM provider to receive suggestions of title and description.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_15.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Copilot chat title generation</strong>: Upon the first user prompt, the content is sent to an LLM provider to update the chat title, reflecting the nature of the conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_16.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dashboard name generation</strong>: When renaming the dashboard, we send the title and descriptions of all widgets on that dashboard to an LLM provider, to ensure that the suggested name is relevant.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_17.png"></p>
<p>To allow firms to keep their data within their network, one of our enterprise features is the option to disable these AI workflows.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="900" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-21-chatgpt-and-the-future-of-ai-in-finance_18.png"></p>
<p>In the future, we could direct these AI workflows to use an LLM that our customers are running locally.</p>
<h2 id="so-in-a-nutshell-what-can-you-expect-from-openbb">So, in a nutshell, what can you expect from OpenBB?</h2>
<p>We are building an AI-powered research workspace.</p>
<p>At the core it is an AI compound system, where users can bring their own data (structured, unstructured, API, custom backend, database, data warehouse, etc..) and have our (or their own copilot) access all this data seamlessly - in an interface that is customizable, flexible and enables teams to work together.</p>

<p>Exploring the parallels between boxing and startup life, and how both push me beyond my comfort zone to foster personal growth, resilience, and continuous learning.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>Recently, I finished reading “The Art of Learning” - a really good book that I’ve recommend to everyone (btw, <a href="https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1742748040220328189?s=20">here</a> is a page of all the books I’ve read in the past few years).</p>
<p>In it, the author Josh Waitzkin, reflects on his journey from chess champion to martial arts practicioner - and how anyone can master the art of learning.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="300" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing_1.png"></p>
<p>It made me wonder, why at 29 years old did I decide to step into a ring with boxers who have been fighting for 10+ years? 🥊</p>
<p>As my friend Max says, “You don’t play boxing”. So why am I doing it?</p>
<p>Similar to setting up a startup, this isn’t something that’s easy to explain. The most rationale thing to do would be to go for a run outside or just go to the gym.</p>
<p>Yet, I hop in a ring to fight.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>For starters, there’s something thrilling about stepping into the ring and knowing that you are going to get punched.</p>
<p>You need to get comfortable with something that - by definition - it’s uncomfortable.</p>
<h2 id="boxing-is-the-physical-to-what-startups-are-for-the-mind">Boxing is the physical to what startups are for the mind</h2>
<p>Think about it. Most activities that people do in their spare time have a “controlled” level of intensity. You get progressively more tired but “know” it’s coming - e.g. gym, swimming, tennis, running, etc.</p>
<p>Contact sports are in general like this too, although every now and then you can get injured. Although this rate is small, and sports in general equip athletes to be protected against injuries.</p>
<p>Boxing (and martial arts) don’t work this way. You step in the ring and within the first few seconds, you may get a hook that gives you a bruise next to your eye or a uppercut that makes you stop breathing for a few seconds.</p>
<p>My point is that with boxing, you don’t know when you are going to get hurt, but you learn to be comfortable with it and over time your body gets used to that level of pain - so it will take even more to make you uncomfortable.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing_2.png"></p>
<h2 id="first-sparring-session">First sparring session</h2>
<p>I still remember my first sparring session, I got hit on the nose and had tears coming out of my eyes from it. My nose hurt for 3 days in a row. It doesn’t matter how many times the coach told me to keep my hands up, nothing taught me quicker than that cross on my nose.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the fight, I was mostly protecting myself and keeping my distance. I was “humbled” by the other fighter, and was pushed to outside my comfort zone.</p>
<p>This is not so much different from startup life where mentally you have to be in uncomfortable places - for me this is the equivalent to speaking on a stage. For an introvert like myself, that was something that was hard to overcome. Although I am still not comfortable on a stage, I am much more comfortable than I used to be.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing_3.png"></p><p style="font-size:0.8em">Presenting at CIBC a few weeks ago at New York AI meetup</p><p></p>
<h2 id="next-sparring-sessions">Next sparring sessions</h2>
<p>Currently when I step in a ring I have mixed feelings, I’m somewhat anxious but also excited about it.</p>
<p>It’s weird.</p>
<p>I mean, I know full well that I’m going against folks who’ve been in a ring since they were young - and I also know full well that I’m going to get hit much more than I will hit.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, there’s something exciting (poetic maybe?) about knowing that each time I step into the ring again, I will be able to land more punches, avoid more hits and be better mentally.</p>
<p>Learning is the nature of the game.</p>
<p>And the only failure is to not take any lessons from each fight.</p>
<p>This is the same for startups. I like what Bezos has to say on the topic, about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HmYj-UDT8jM">pushing Amazon to embrace failure</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="300" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-09-09-why-i-love-boxing_4.JPG"></p><p style="font-size:0.8em">This picture was what convinced me to buy my own head gear</p><p></p>
<h2 id="so-why-do-i-love-boxing">So, why do I love boxing?</h2>
<p>I think ultimately, the reason why I love boxing is the same as why I love startups.</p>
<p>Startups push me everyday to be the best that I can be in so many different areas, there isn’t a role that - for me - is as stimulating mentally as being a startup founder.</p>
<p>There are 100 different initiatives ongoing at all times, you have a team of composed of human beings (by nature, highly complex with different backgrounds and life experiences), you have startups trying to disrupt your business, you have well established incumbents, etc..</p>
<p>Boxing is the same... but at the physical level.</p>
<p>I step in the ring and need to be the best I can in multiple verticals - it isn’t enough to be the best in one.</p>
<p>I need to have a faster reaction to avoid punches, be light on my feet to surprise an opponent, land the combos where I put most of my energy in, trade-off balance between combos and stamina, and obviously all the mental side that comes from it too - which turns out is quite a lot.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as cheesy as it sounds, being a startup founder and doing boxing make me feel alive.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As AI continues to advance, many jobs in finance are at risk. Learn why this shift is happening and how to prepare for the future.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-06-why-ai-will-replace-jobs-in-finance-and-how-you-should-prepare.png"></p>
<p>It's not a matter of if, but a matter of when. AI will replace analysts' jobs, and we actually believe that's a good thing. In this blog post, we explain why and how you can prepare for this revolutionary change in the world of finance.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the current state of Quant/Finance/Investing conferences in 2024</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-06-why-ai-will-replace-jobs-in-finance-and-how-you-should-prepare_1.png"></p>
<p>I’ve heard panels defending both sides: Yes and No.</p>
<p>I think that people who say “No” don’t understand how AI fundamentally works, and most people who say “Yes” are understating the impact it will have.</p>
<p>Personally, a much better question is “When will AI replace financial analysts?” or “How can I prepare for the shift?”.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>If we look back at the automotive industry, 100 years ago - this is what a Ford factory looked like:</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-06-why-ai-will-replace-jobs-in-finance-and-how-you-should-prepare.png"></p>
<p>How many of these blue-collar workers would have said that their jobs would be extinct in less than 100 years? And for the most part, they are.</p>
<p>This is where we are today in terms of AI.</p>
<p>Some tooling (read: AI) can help humans do their job, but it still needs to be supervised.</p>
<p>But with enough time (for the automotive industry that was 100 years), AI will take over.</p>
<p>This is what Tesla’s Giga Berlin factory looks like today.</p>
<div class="flex place-items-center justify-center items-center rounded-sm mx-auto"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7-4yOx1CnXE?si=k-adJ_cOlXS6Ldlv" width="800" height="400"></iframe></div>
<h2 id="when-will-ai-replace-financial-analysts">When will AI replace financial analysts?</h2>
<p>Bill Gates famously said: “Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years”.</p>
<p>I’ve found this to be mostly true for everything tech.</p>
<p>EXCEPT AI.</p>
<p>This is why I’m so bullish on the category as a whole.</p>
<p>I subscribe to a few newsletters that share daily AI updates, and it’s crazy that every single day there’s something big happening. Either a new model is released and open source, a new framework to do RAG or fine-tune, a new company announces they are working on foundational models, a new paper that pushes the field forward, or a new investment from a big corporation.</p>
<p>I mean, even enterprises are rushing to jump into the AI train. Either releasing AI features to millions of users before proper testing (e.g. Gemini overview on Google and the whole Reddit answers), adding AI where it isn’t really necessary (e.g. Meta AI on WhatsApp), exploring new monetization opportunities (e.g. Amazon Bedrock for fine-tuning) or risking on their values to not be left behind (e.g. Apple partnering with OpenAI — risking the security brand they worked so hard for).</p>
<p>So, I think this will happen soon.</p>
<p>And it’s with that in mind that we have been building OpenBB.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-prepare-for-the-shift">How can I prepare for the shift?</h2>
<p>I think that the most important question that financial analysts should ask themselves is not ‘<strong>when</strong>’ but ‘<strong>what can I do to prepare myself for when AI starts taking over</strong>’.</p>
<p>There’s going to be multiple stages before AI fully takes over. Here’s how I envision it playing out:</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-06-why-ai-will-replace-jobs-in-finance-and-how-you-should-prepare_2.png"></p>
<p>(For what it’s worth, I think this is equivalent to what will happen to developers in general).</p>
<h3 id="short-term">Short term</h3>
<p>We are starting to enter this timeline.</p>
<p>A timeline where analysts will use AI to augment their output.</p>
<p>A good analyst using AI will be able to perform at a better level than a great analyst who doesn’t use AI.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a mediocre analyst will be able to increase their output but nowhere as much as a good or great analyst. This is because the AI usage will supervised and still “driven” by the analyst (through prompts). So mediocre analysts will not benefit as much because they will either trust too much the AI (without being able to discern its validity), not use the best prompts because they don’t know what to use the AI for, or not use the output because they won’t comprehend the insights that the AI is generating.</p>
<p>During this period, the gap between mediocre and great analysts will be at an all-time high. This will expose more who is pushing their weight and who isn’t.</p>
<p>Another thing is that firms that will be hiring high-talented juniors/interns will start adding AI experience as a requirement (e.g. OpenBB experience) since they understand that they will have a higher leverage and their output will be much better. Potentially even replacing a current analyst with many years of experience that doesn’t leverage AI in the day-to-day.</p>
<p>I think there are 2 reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>AI will allow financial analysts to have much broader mandates</strong> as they will be able to automate the process of research and screen the best companies. Instead of analyzing 20 companies per quarter, they will do 500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI will be able to extract trends and patterns that humans simply can’t due to the amount of data necessary to process</strong>. The amount of data that financial firms use to invest is constantly on the rise, that’s where they get their alpha from. Given that an analyst has a limited amount of resources, they will either have to narrow down the companies in their mandate or process less data for each.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="long-term">Long term</h3>
<p>In the long term, AI will start taking the reigns.</p>
<p>This is the equivalent of self-driving cars becoming fully autonomous.</p>
<p>The gap between mediocre and great analysts will narrow over time because AI is doing all the heavy work.</p>
<p>At that time, it will be very hard to distinguish the competency of mediocre and great analysts — the main indicator will be how they interpret/understand the AI model, i.e. how they can explain what led to the AI “deciding” to invest in companies based on hundreds of different datasets.</p>
<p>This is why we spend hours obsessing over the UX of the <a href="https://openbb.co/products/pro">OpenBB Terminal Pro</a>. We want to make sure analysts know at all times what the AI Copilot is doing and thinking. Because interpretability will be a big topic in the future.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the best analysts will be the ones who have their jobs more secure over time. That is because provided the AI is taking the reigns, when it fully takes the reigns, the output of all analysts will be more or less the same. However, in the period before, the great analyst will have an edge because their skill is still in use and so the leverage lever is bigger.</p>
<p>I think that when AI fully takes over analysts' jobs, the best ones will move towards opening their investment firms and focus on the human part of the job: communication.</p>
<p>Communicating to their investors why they made their decisions, e.g. “We have access to this dataset which others don’t, and our AI model correlated that data with x, y, and z which enabled us to invest ahead of the rest of the market”. This is the “interpretability” of the AI that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-you-do">What can you do?</h2>
<p>You should still pursue a career in the space.</p>
<p>But you should do so with AI in mind.</p>
<p>Experiment with products out there that leverage AI to make you more efficient (you can try OpenBB for free at pro.openbb.co). You will soon realize that your output can compete with someone who is neglecting AI in their day-to-day.</p>
<p>Being a top financial analyst is still something you should strive for since these are going to be the last to be replaced. And when they are, you will still have an edge because your role is likely to evolve into a communication/management role that explains what the AI is doing to investors. And that would be much easier if you’re a top analyst in the first place - because you would understand the insights extracted from an AI copilot.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life.JPG"></p>
<p>In a time when we talk about going to Mars and having AGI, cancer is still taking lives every day.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>This cause could not have been a personal one, but it is.</p>
<p>As a young kid from a small town in Portugal, people who die from cancer are on TV and I don't know them personally.
&nbsp;
My friends &amp; family are “protected” by an imaginary shield that I created in my head.</p>
<p>Until they aren’t.</p>
<p>Let me go back down memory lane and talk about Beatriz.</p>
<p>Bia was in my class in high school.</p>
<p>We started talking here and there.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, she was my best friend.</p>
<p>We would talk for hours about everything and nothing - always laughing.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life.JPG"></p>
<p>We would sit next to each other and professors would have a hard time with us because we liked to chit chat.</p>
<p>So we created a new communication medium to not get caught.</p>
<p>We would rip the side of those pages and write in very small font notes to each other.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life_1.jpg"></p>
<p>We would go through multiple of these in each class.</p>
<p>It was our thing.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life_2.JPG"></p>
<p>A few months later, we had a sports class and she felt weak from her wrist.</p>
<p>She didn't really like sports. So I remember making fun of her for trying to find an excuse to skip sports class.</p>
<p>That would be the last time I made fun of that.</p>
<p>She went to the hospital the day after, and to another one soon for a second opinion.</p>
<p>She had cancer. On her back.</p>
<p>Her floor was pulled from under her.</p>
<p>She was 16 and while kids her age were worrying about boys and school grades, she had to fight for her life.</p>
<p>At fucking 16.</p>
<p>The crazy part is that the attitude she had with others was the same.</p>
<p>She would not display any weakness throughout none of it.</p>
<p>She was so strong. At 16.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life_3.png"></p>
<p>One day I visited her and she had no hair because of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>She was still the same beautiful and happy girl that I loved.</p>
<p>Underneath it all, I don't know where she got the strength to go through it.</p>
<p>The school adapted the classes to be livestream so that she could attend from home.</p>
<p>Not only she wasn't gonna lose this battle but she didn't want to lose 1 year of school either.</p>
<p>She was incredibly smart for her age. So losing a year wasn't an option for her.</p>
<p>At the graduation she wrote me a message. She didn't have strength in her hand to write so she used her wrist to be able to write it in an iPad.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life_4.JPG"></p>
<p>The translation doesn’t make it justice, but it reads as:</p>
<blockquote><p>Didier</p><br><p>It was in the middle of laughter, in the middle of playfulness.</p><br><p>It was in the middle of tantrums and misunderstandings.</p><br><p>It was in the middle of sheets of paper fallen on the floor and of pieces of paper so efficiently utilized.</p><br><p>It was like this that our friendship grew!</p><br><p>Beatriz ❤️</p></blockquote>
<br>
<p>Saturday morning I got a call. A common friend let me know that she passed away unexpectedly.</p>
<p>I was still in bed. I cried for hours. I didn't want to wake up. Maybe some part of me never did.</p>
<p>She had her entire life ahead of her.</p>
<p>She was kind, curious and loving. She would have accomplished so much.</p>
<p>Yet she was gone.</p>
<p>No one deserves to lose their best friend at 17. Not like that. It wasn't fair.</p>
<p>But that's cancer for you.</p>
<p>Cancer doesn't care.</p>
<p>It never did.</p>
<p>From that moment onwards I changed my attitude towards life.</p>
<p>I stopped doing things for the sake of doing them and always put 120%.</p>
<p>I went from spending most of my time as a gamer and doing just enough to have good grades in high school to being the best student of my year in my BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering, moving to London to have a distinction at Imperial College London (top 2 uni in the world) and now moving to NYC to increase chances of success for my startup.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-08-01-inspired-by-bia-how-her-fight-against-cancer-changed-my-life_5.jpeg"></p>
<p>I have a tattoo that says “All her would-haves are our opportunities" (which is from Anne Frank's house in Amsterdam) to remind me that every day I have opportunities that she didn't get to experience.</p>
<p>But I hope that in some way, shape or form, she is.</p>
<p>And that I make her proud.</p>
<p>Stories like this are not as uncommon as you may think they are.</p>
<p>It took me over 10 years to talk about how cancer took my best friend’s life away.</p>
<p>Imagine the number of people who never write about how it impacted their lives.</p>
<p>If anything, my objective with this post is to highlight that cancer is real.</p>
<p>In a time when we talk about going to Mars and having AGI, cancer is still taking lives every day...</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI will change education forever. Here's how I leveraged Perplexity, Cursor and ChatGPT to teach Supervised Learning and assess coursework.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt.png"></p>
<p>AI will change education forever. Here's how I leveraged Perplexity, Cursor and ChatGPT to teach Supervised Learning and assess coursework.</p>
<p>The open source code is available <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/supervised-learning">here</a>.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>Recently I was invited to teach a course in Big Data and Data Analytics at Europeia University. I gave 4 hours of classes, divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervised Learning - Theory</li>
<li>Supervised Learning - Practice</li>
</ul>
<p>And then evaluated the students coursework.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-syllabus">Creating a new syllabus</h2>
<p>My past experience as a teacher happened during my BSc., back in 2016, where I was a TA for the course of Signal Theory and had to help students in their coursework through Matlab/Octave.</p>
<p>Things were different at the time because I had a syllabus to follow and most of my time was spent helping students if they were blocked coding-wise or had some questions regarding the theory.</p>
<p>And of course - there was no AI. At least not in the sense that we speak about today - i.e. there were no LLMs.</p>
<p>This time was different - I had the flexibility to choose what I was going to cover about Supervised Learning.</p>
<p>I’ve never worked as a Data Scientist per se, but have been passionate about data for a while and spent a lot of time reading books and learning about the topic. In my previous company, I started playing with IMU data in my spare time which lead me to publish a paper at ICMLA where I used <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9680024">Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Step Detection using Nurvv trackers</a> and even open sourced the code <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/step-detection-ML/tree/main">here</a>.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_svm_paper.png"></p>
<p>I've wrote about this and how I managed to write the entire code in my spare time in a single week, and missing the yearly team event in order to pull this off. You can read more about it <a href="https://didierlopes.com/blog/how-i-wrote-a-machine-learning-paper-in-1-week-that-got-accepted-to-icmla">here</a>.</p>
<p>But so the question is:</p>
<p><em>"Where do I start?"</em></p>
<p>My first intuition was to gather some of my favorite books and courses on the topic and understand how they presented the overall subject. I wouldn’t have the same time, so I would need to touch on most topics briefly - enough for students to know about it and explore further if curious.</p>
<p>However, given my time constraints with running OpenBB, I would have had a hard time since I would need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consume the content of these books and courses</li>
<li>Mix and match them</li>
<li>Cut to fit the time constraints</li>
<li>Produce a final syllabus that I’m confident about</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>This was not a trivial task, and definitely not a weekend job.</p>
<p>Except that <strong>IT WAS</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="perplexity-enters-the-chat">Perplexity enters the chat</h3>
<p>Since Perplexity’s main value proposition is being better at Google than Google - I popped the following prompt into it.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_perplexity.png"></p>
<p>BAM.💥</p>
<p>This was exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Did it give me the content end-to-end that I was expecting?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Was it a perfect starting point?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I didn’t literally copy-paste it. I took the parts I liked, re-iterated on the ones I didn't until I eventually did. Plus, use my experience to prioritize parts that I felt should be more relevant vs others.</p>
<p>Were there some hallucinations?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s not a silver bullet.</p>
<p>But it saved me DAYS of work.</p>
<p>I was dreading having to write the syllabus and like this, it was actually fun. It was fun because I felt like Perplexity was acting as my assistant and I was engaging in a conversation of what should be contained within the course and what shouldn’t.</p>
<p>After having all the content ready, I asked my wife to help me with some images to make it easier for students to understand concepts.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_assets.png"></p>
<p>I was happy with the results - but wanted a second opinion. So I asked a friend of mine who’s been a DS for over 6 years what his thoughts were on the materials I worked on - and he was impressed about the speed.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_ai_friend_message.jpeg"></p>
<p>Being a fan of open source, I have open sourced all the theory and practice of the course and you can access it here: <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/supervised-learning">https://github.com/DidierRLopes/supervised-learning</a></p>
<p>For the practice exercises I made it so that users can run it with colab directly on the browser to focus on the learning and not on the installation of libraries - highly recommend doing this.</p>

<p>After presenting the classes to the students, they had to work on a final project that involved supervised learning - and I had to grade their work on it. The grade was from 0 to 5 and I was given freedom in terms of what criteria to use.</p>
<p>So I did what someone else in my shoes would do.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-to-define-grading-criteria">ChatGPT to define grading criteria</h2>
<p>I typed <a href="http://chat.openai.com/">chat.openai.com</a> and had a conversation with ChatGPT about the best way to grade the coursework. I wanted it to be as fair as possible, but also evaluate students based on criteria outside of coding, such as problem formulation and documentation/clarity.</p>
<p>Note: Story for another day but with the raise of LLMs, I have a very strong opinion that documentation and clarity will be as important as the code itself.</p>
<p>This is the outcome of that conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PART I - Problem Formulation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1.a. <strong>Clarity and Definition:</strong> Is the problem clearly defined and well-formulated? Are the project's objectives explicitly mentioned?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.b. <strong>Relevance and Context:</strong> Is the relevance of the problem within the application domain explained? Does the problem justify the use of supervised learning?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PART II - Documentation and Quality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2.a. Code Quality and Readability:</strong> Clarity and Structure: Is the code well-organized with clear and consistent formatting? Are comments used effectively to explain complex logic? Best Practices: Does the code follow standard coding practices (e.g., naming conventions, modularization)? Are functions and classes used appropriately?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.b. Documentation and Explanation in Comments or Notebook Markdown</strong>: Clarity: Are the results and methodology clearly documented? Is there a detailed explanation of the steps taken and the reasons behind them? Visualization: Are visual aids (e.g., graphs, plots) used to illustrate key points and results? Are these visualizations clear and informative?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PART III - Code</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.a. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning</strong>: Completeness: Are all necessary steps for data preprocessing included (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features)? Justification: Are the preprocessing steps justified and explained? Is there a clear reason for the choices made?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.b. Data Exploration</strong>: Initial Analysis: Is there an exploratory data analysis? Are descriptive statistics used to better understand the data? Visualization: Are visualizations (e.g., graphs, plots) used to illustrate data distribution, correlations, and important patterns? Are these visualizations clear and informative?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.c. Model Implementation and Training</strong>: Correctness: Is the model implemented correctly according to the chosen algorithm? Are appropriate libraries and functions used? Parameter Tuning: Is there evidence of parameter tuning or optimization? Are the chosen parameters explained and justified?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.d. Evaluation and Validation</strong>: Metrics: Are appropriate evaluation metrics chosen and calculated? Are these metrics relevant to the problem at hand? Validation Techniques: Are appropriate validation techniques used (e.g., cross-validation, train-test split)? Is there an analysis of the model's performance on both training and testing data?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>This was it.</p>
<p>Exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Now I could grade a student on each of these criteria, then select a final grade weight for each criteria (e.g. 5-15%), create a spreadsheet with such a table and call it a day.</p>
<p>However, the most time-consuming task was coming - the grading itself.</p>
<p>There were 10 groups in total. So 10 notebooks that I had to look into, exploring completely different datasets with a different ML model being used, different ways to do exploratory data analysis, different ways to assess the model, different objectives, …</p>
<h3 id="cursor-helping-with-grading">Cursor helping with grading</h3>
<p>I opened <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">cursor</a> (which is basically VSCode + ChatGPT) and probably the software I’ve recommended the most to developers in 2024.</p>
<p>And opened my first notebook.</p>
<p>Then I thought, what if I had GPT-4o on my side - helping me to assess this coursework.</p>
<p>It didn’t need to be perfect because I was doing it myself, but it could help me understand if there was any critical thing that I missed OR if it completely had a different grade than the one I was going to provide - which would enable me to spend more time on that criteria and iterate.</p>
<p>It gave me confidence that I was being fair to the students.</p>
<p>And made me realize how hard it is for professors when they have 100s of students and have a subjective answer to grade. It’s impossible to get it right. They try their best, but as soon as the answer is not binary (0 or 1), they are doomed to fail.</p>
<p>So how did I do it?</p>
<p>Given that I just wanted GPT-4o to quickly review each of the criterias based on the code, I created a prompt that I could use for all of notebooks that the students sent.</p>
<p>This is what my setup looked like</p>
<p align="center"><img width="1000" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_cursor.png"></p>
<p>Having the code on the left side and the copilot on the right side that I could use to chat really enabled me to grade more confidently.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a section of a response I got to one of the student’s notebooks</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-30-my-first-hand-experience-on-ai-impacting-education-through-perplexity-cursor-and-chatgpt_cursor_output.png"></p>
<p>One thing I did to have the copilot produce better outputs was to push it to do chain-of-thought (CoT). Meaning that I prompted the model to explain the reasoning behind a decision before providing a grade. This has been proved to yield to less hallucinations and more accurate responses - which is what I was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>What if I wanted to do this at scale?</strong></p>
<p>I would have put more effort into the prompt and focused on evaluating 1 criteria at a time. I would have done few-shot prompting where I put examples of what grades 1,2,3,4,5 look like for such criteria so the model has those references and can check for similarity of issues committed or successful tasks performed.</p>
<p>Note: the model was able to interpret comments written in Portuguese which is another benefit.</p>
<h2 id="democratizing-access-to-tutors">Democratizing access to tutors</h2>
<p>While I was working on my prompts to get some feedback from AI in terms of student’s coursework I realized that I only need $20/mo to access them.</p>
<p>But then I realized - so do the students.</p>
<p>This means that the students have no reason to NOT run their entire coursework by a LLM that can act as a critic of their work.</p>
<p>They can keep iterating until the model doesn’t find anything - hence making students feel more confident about the work they are putting forward.</p>
<p>My initial thought was: “this feels like cheating” (right after the - “I wish I had this a few years ago”).</p>
<p>But it actually isn’t.</p>
<p>Tutors have existed for a long time.</p>
<p>Students pay tutors to spend time with them to learn outside of classes - whether it’s explaining the theory or helping with coursework.</p>
<p>However, tutors are a vitamin and not a painkiller (they are a nice-to-have and not a must-have). And because they aren’t a requirement, it’s not a typical choice among lower-income families.</p>
<p>On the other hand, kids from wealthy families often have multiple tutors. Not for students who are almost failing their class, but who want to bump their grades from A- to an A+.</p>
<p>But this is about to change.</p>
<p>For the most part, GPT-3.5 is accessible for free.</p>
<p>This means that everyone can have access to a tutor that they can work with to have better grades but also produce better coursework.</p>
<p>This means that the concept of a tutor will be democratized and the playing field between students who come from different wealth backgrounds will be leveled and fair.</p>
<h2 id="a-final-thought-on-open-source">A final thought on open source</h2>
<p>Another class that I had to give to students was "Data Analytics in Financial Markets".</p>
<p>The goal here was to have a more real-life application of data analytics, particularly in financial markets - and even feature OpenBB which has partnered with this university.</p>
<p>But when I started working on the content from scratch, I wondered.</p>
<p>Can't I find a repository on GitHub that suits my needs?</p>
<p>And I did.</p>
<p>The GitHub repository I found was the GitHub repository that contains the code for the case studies in the O'Reilly book "Machine Learning and Data Science Blueprints for Finance" written by my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hariomtatsat/">Hariom Tatsat</a>: <a href="https://github.com/tatsath/fin-ml">https://github.com/tatsath/fin-ml</a>.</p>
<p>So why would I spend the time re-inventing the wheel when I could just walk students through a few of these case studies?</p>
<p>This is what I did.</p>
<p>Which then made me think that all of this data has been already fed into foundational models, and so even if I were to apply the same approach I did earlier with Perplexity or ChatGPT - it is likely that with a good prompt some of the main examples would have been derived from this repository.</p>
<p>But in this case, this repository already had the perfect case-study format I was looking for, and so I can more easily credit the author.</p>
<p>which made me wonder:</p>
<p><em>How will open source authors be able to get credit for their work when all of it is being translated into weights in a big neural network architecture?</em></p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Financial assistants structured like ChatGPT are great for quick searches but fall short for comprehensive investment research.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future.png"></p>
<p>Financial assistants structured like ChatGPT are great for quick searches but fall short for comprehensive investment research. They are limited by their one-dimensional approach, which hinders efficient data retrieval and long-term usability. Read on to discover how OpenBB Terminal Pro addresses these issues with a three-dimensional solution.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>This is a spicy take but bear with me.</p>
<p>The more I think about “ChatGPT for Finance” products, the more I think this is not the answer.</p>
<p>They are extremely good knowledge retrieval engines because you can ask what you want to know and get the answer immediately.</p>
<p>My problem with their approach is what happens after.</p>
<p>However, very little thought is given to the real-world investment workflow. That's why I strongly believe that a chat-only financial platform will never be successful on its own.</p>
<p>Sure, they can win in the categories of “search” or “screening”, but they won’t be able to compete in the category of “investment research platform”.</p>
<p>To do that, they would need to evolve.</p>
<p>Let me explain why and how OpenBB differs from them.</p>
<h2 id="1-dimensional-vs-n-dimensional">1-Dimensional vs N-Dimensional</h2>
<p>Financial assistants are, in general, 1-dimensional. By that, I mean that all you have on a screen is a “dashboard” with an unlimited y-axis (1 single dimension).</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future_1.png"></p>
<p>This means that whatever information they output will always be in the same position, which is great for the short term.</p>
<p>But for the long term? Not so much. If the user wants to find specific information, they will need to keep scrolling up the text to find it.</p>
<p>When financial assistants allow multiple conversations, then we start having 2 dimensions, where each conversation introduces a new axis.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that you can’t easily find data within one of those past conversations since the assistant focuses on answering your question and not on data retrieval from the previous outputs.</p>
<h2 id="our-3-dimensional-solution-on-terminal-pro">Our 3-dimensional solution on Terminal Pro</h2>
<p>How do we handle those issues? We have 3 dimensions.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future_2.png"></p>
<p>Our Terminal Pro has a Copilot on the side, similar to other financial assistants.</p>
<p>However, its big advantage is that when you want to save Copilot’s output for later, you can convert it into a text widget. And when you do so, you can place it wherever you want in this space — with the axis being infinite vertical scroll, tabs, dashboards, and folders.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/ebdda68a-95f7-425b-aebe-5c98936c9189"></video>
<h2 id="storage-based-solutions-are-not-optimized-for-investment-research">Storage-based solutions are not optimized for investment research</h2>
<p>Again, financial assistants are optimized for search rather than information storage.</p>
<p>This means that, by nature, chat-only financial assistants assume that their output will not matter in the future, so they answer your queries similarly to how a text conversation works. It's literally called ChatGPT for that reason.</p>
<p>However, that’s not ideal for investment research.</p>
<p>If analysts and researchers need to access these financial assistants' output at some point in the future, they won’t be able to do it quickly. Instead, they’ll have to go through a long chat history.</p>
<p>This is why, in our Terminal Pro, we allow users to create a markdown-based text widget from the Copilot’s output, as shown above, so that you can have that information quickly accessible, but also editable.</p>
<h2 id="theres-no-simple-way-to-know-where-the-data-comes-from">There’s no simple way to know where the data comes from</h2>
<p>Financial assistants are great, and they are improving every day. But if there’s something I’ve learned from talking with financial firms for over three years, it's that this is a very slow-moving industry, and adopting new technologies takes time.</p>
<p>But with AI, it seems different. It’s so revolutionary that people are willing to incorporate it into their workflow faster because they immediately understand the benefits it can bring to their business.</p>
<p>However, hallucinations are still a big problem — so it’s essential for these firms to be able to verify the raw data and sources.</p>
<p>The current level of AI is equivalent to having a smart intern that you would need to double-check their work or trust but verify.</p>
<p>This is why our Copilot always answers based on data that is readily available on the dashboard — and (due to our “Bring Your Own Data” technology) that data can be brought by your firm rather than being limited to what we offer out of the box.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future_3.png"></p>
<h2 id="financial-chats-are-not-collaborative">Financial chats are not collaborative</h2>
<p>Financial assistants are not collaborative by default.</p>
<p>When someone opens a tool like ChatGPT, they are interested in getting an answer to their question. Can you imagine what would happen if more people had access to that conversation and asked ChatGPT a different question? That would translate into a horrible user experience.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that investment research starts as an individual process but ends up being a collaborative effort where the findings are shared and discussed within a team.</p>
<p>So, financial assistants have a challenging task: multiple people on a team should be able to access all the conversations without being able to interact with these chats.</p>
<p>But what if you go through a colleague’s chat where they were asking questions about a company’s earnings, and you want to do a follow-up question?</p>
<p>That’s a complex problem.</p>
<p>At OpenBB, we are in a very good position to solve this for our users.</p>
<p>Since we allow them to create a widget from their conversation with the Copilot, users can effectively create the ideal dashboard to share with their team. On their turn, other team members will then be able to use the Copilot on that same dashboard to make their questions.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>This can be considered yet another dimension that we allow users to explore.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-15-why-chat-only-AI-Financial-Assistants-are-not-the-future_4.png"></p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
<p>In a nutshell,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most AI financial assistant products are 1-dimensional. Great at retrieving an answer quickly but poor at the overall task of doing investment research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenBB Terminal Pro is positioning itself as a flexible and customizable investment research platform with N-dimensions that an AI copilot can control to produce a full investment dashboard as if it were an analyst.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm biased, but once we provide the OpenBB Copilot with the capability to interact with the interface (create widgets, dashboards and folders) we might be the company that gets closest to replace an analyst's job.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-06-05-29-years-old-and-sitting-on-the-top-of-giants.png"></p>
<p>Yesterday was my 29th birthday, and I was reflecting on my life and on how sitting on the top of giants isn’t given enough credit. My giants are my parents.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>Yesterday I turned 29 years old.</p>
<p>The night before, I was speaking with my dad about how grateful I am for everything he’s done for my brother and I.  I always had everything - food at the table, a roof and education.</p>
<p>I’m the person I am today because of my parents.</p>
<p>But my dad didn’t have it easy.</p>
<p>And so instead of writing about how grateful I am for the life I have today, I want to share some parts of my dad’s life.</p>
<p>I don’t like to share personal information about my family, but I feel like from all the posts I read on success - sitting on the top of giants isn’t given enough credit.</p>
<p>My giants are my parents.</p>
<p>Here’s his story.</p>
<p>My dad grew up with very little in a town in the middle of nowhere in Portugal with 6 siblings.</p>
<p>He did a few years in school and after classes he would come home and watch his parents sheep until it was dark. He did his homework during that time since there was no electricity back then.</p>
<p>If a sheep ran away while he was doing his homework, his dad would punish him with whatever was at hand, a stick or a belt.</p>
<p>Times were different back then.</p>
<p>In school, if he got questions like 7x8 wrong, teachers wouldn’t just say the correct answer. They had a special ruler that was used to hit a student’s hand.</p>
<p>Again, times were different.</p>
<p>After a couple of years in school - he didn’t like it (I wonder why eh) and they didn’t have a lot of money. So he started working at the age of 11 in construction.</p>
<p>An 11 year old kid, taking 2 buckets of cement up and down the stairs to build houses.</p>
<p>At the age of 17 he moved to Geneva (Switzerland) for a better paid job, as a bricklayer but also did painting jobs and similar.</p>
<p>At 18, his mum died.  She was run over by a car near our hometown.</p>
<p>At 20, he had to come to Portugal because of his passport and he met my mum.</p>
<p>1 year later, my mum moved to Geneva to be with him. She worked in a factory making boxes for Rolex watches.</p>
<p>At 22, his dad died from a disease.</p>
<p>He kept working his ass off. 6 days a week, starting at 6 am whether it was snowing, raining or extremely hot.</p>
<p>No travelling or unnecessary expenses, except tobacco, it was his only addiction as everyone around him smoked - it was a social thing.</p>
<p>At 24 he got married with my mum. My mum’s family didn’t like his, so they didn’t attend the wedding and they had to cover it with all of their savings.</p>
<p>At 31, he had me.</p>
<p>The week before I was born would be the last he would ever smoke, since my mum said that she didn’t want smoke near us because of our health. At some point he was smoking 2 packs a day, and he stopped from one day to the other which is wild.</p>
<p>At 32 his painting shift had just finished and his boss asked him to give one more painting layer to the outside of an apartment. And he went up the ladder, and it broke. He fell from a 2-story apartment on his foot, and his foot bone got smashed into pieces. (He had actually mentioned to his boss that the ladder didn’t feel very stable earlier that day).
 The doctor told him that he would never be able to do any physical work ever again. 24 years later, and he still struggles to walk for long periods of time.</p>
<p>At 33, he had my brother.</p>
<p>Because of the accident, he stayed at home to raise my brother and I.</p>
<p>A bit after, Portugal joined the Euro. So my dad thought that the living conditions in Portugal would improve overall like other European countries (spoiler alert: it didn’t).</p>
<p>So, he decided to start building a house on the same land where his hometown house was, in Portugal.</p>
<p>They couldn’t afford to buy a house in Geneva, but had enough savings that they could build one in his hometown.</p>
<p>They went back when he was 39 (I was 8), and that’s where I grew up.</p>
<p>My mum struggled to find a job for many years - she only got a job as a secretary at a furniture store - until they went bankrupt.</p>
<p>My dad had depression since he was stuck at home with nothing to do.</p>
<p>Growing up, I wanted to work as a bricklayer in summers to make some cash and my dad forbid me doing so.</p>
<p>He said that it was dangerous and he didn’t want me to have that life. He has seen a lot of young people dropping out of school because they start receiving salaries early and prioritise short-term outcomes over long-term ones.</p>
<p>He didn’t want me to follow that path.</p>
<p>He wanted to give me the opportunities that he didn’t have growing up. And he did.</p>
<p>One day I got home from high school, and commented that someone I knew always had expensive clothes and watches. He happened to know their family and got upset. He was upset because he knew that they owed a lot of money to a lot of people - and kept living a luxury lifestyle.
 So he told me “You may not wear all of that, but you will never hear in your life that we owe anything to anyone. Everything you have has been bought with a lot of hard work from your mother and I, and not by stealing or owing anything to anyone”.</p>
<p>I still think about this often, and how appearances are often just that.</p>
<p>A few years later after I got into university, my parents decided to move back to Switzerland.</p>
<p>My mum still didn’t have a job and we weren’t going home as much (we both studied relatively far from our hometown). It was hard on her to move away from us, but it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>She found a job as a cleaner, which she has been doing for almost 10 years now.</p>
<p>In the meantime my dad wondered if he could leverage all the skills he had learned growing up to manage a housing project. So he bought land in Portugal, and was heavily involved in the management of the project. Meaning he worked across everything, except the physical aspects of the job.</p>
<p>It was an investment, but after having so many years in real estate - it was hard for someone to have as much knowledge breadth as he did in terms of costs of materials and staff since he had been on the other side of the coin for a long time.</p>
<p>Now he does that every now and then, which keeps him busy. But since it involves being far from my mum, this time he’s hiring an agency to be more involved at the expense of less headaches and a lower margin.</p>
<p>He has a good life now. But he came from nothing, literally.</p>
<p>Most people on his shoes, don’t make it.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Most people with more opportunities than him don’t make it.</p>
<p>I often feel guilty because I get to live life in a way that my parents could never.</p>
<p>The best way I can think to repay them is to work hard and show them that their hard life will be the last that the future Lopes generation will have to endure.</p>
<p>That and hopefully buying them a nice car one day.</p>]]></content>

<p>I can see a future where people use rabbit r1 for very particular use cases where phone is suboptimal. For instance, when multiple people want to interact with said phone (e.g. selecting music at a party without having to give phone away) and that is not ideal due to personal information on phone, or when the phone isn't ideal because it has too many distractions and user wants to focus on doing something (e.g. practicing a presentation using recording session and then asking for feedback).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-rabbit-r1">What is the rabbit r1</h2>
<p>Rabbit r1 was first introduced at CES 2024 as a pocket AI companion (watch the keynote <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/rabbit-r1">here</a>).</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_1.png"></p>
<p>The main distinction over being just a "ChatGPT on-the-go" is the fact that they introduced what they call a Large Action Model (LAM), which is an agent capable of taking requests and making different function calls (e.g., translation, weather, finance, vision, taking notes, and more).</p>
<p>There are now quite a few consumer products that are trying to win this category. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://humane.com/">AI pin</a> from Humane. MKBHD did a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA">review</a> on this product (or should I say 'bad review'?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.limitless.ai/">pendant</a> from Limitless (previously Rewind AI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.openinterpreter.com/">01</a> from Open Interpreter. I ordered this one because it's <a href="https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter">open source</a> and I can build on top.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While at the surface these devices are somewhat similar, they approach the problem from a different angle. AI pin relies on users to clip their device to their clothes, the pendant is put on the collar of your top and 01 is held handheld. Rabbit r1 is also handheld, but unlike the others contains a screen to interact with - so it's closer to a phone than the others.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, according to Jesse (rabbit's CEO) they are currently the most successful AI device in terms of sales (sold over 100,000 rabbit r1 in a few weeks).</p>
<h2 id="how-i-got-my-r1">How I got my r1</h2>
<p>My wife saw me watching a few videos of rabbit r1 and decided to surprise me with one, a one-time $199 purchase without any subscription fee. I wonder why she didn’t do it when I was watching Apple Vision Pro 😄.</p>
<p>But they didn’t ship immediately. My batch was only meant to be shipped sometime in June. However, rabbit tweeted that there would be a Pickup Party in NYC. I added notifications on their X account and once they announced that registrations were open I was ready. I RSVPd and this week I attended the event to grab mine.</p>
<p>The event was well organized. One thing is for sure, rabbit knows how to build a community and hype with their users.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_2.png"></p>
<p>The keynote presented at the event can be found <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/live-unboxing">here</a>. In it, rabbit's CEO unboxes a rabbit r1 and shows everything it can do on stage.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My experience</h2>
<p>I have been playing with rabbit r1 for a couple of days now. A few funny things I've done since:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jailbreak rabbit r1 to say <a href="https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1783335809459859708">f*ck which falls outside the guidelines</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask it what LLM it was using under the hood, to which it said <a href="https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1783346493832753477">it was using a fine-tuned version of OpenAI's GPT-3</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have rabbit r1 make a <a href="https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1784228313717776505">Deez Nuts joke</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use rabbit r1 as a <a href="https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1784357946920505387">Not Hotdog app</a> (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/">Silicon Valley reference</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But now onto the serious stuff. Since I was at the Pickup Party where Jesse split the presentation based on the major features of the products, I want to address each of these individually after having time to play with them.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>For search, rabbit r1 relies on <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a>. I'm a Perplexity fan myself and at some point I even replaced my default <a href="https://arc.net/">Arc browser</a> search engine with Perplexity. This only lasted one day because then I realized how many times I just wanted to end up on a landing page or on someone's LinkedIn/X. It made me realize why Google is, well, Google. Regardless, this is something that I do with my phone, and so I don't think it's a strong use case.</p>
<p>However, if you have a kid that is curious to understand the world. I think a rabbit r1 is well worth it to use it to ask questions that they are curious about, without having the distractions that a phone provides.</p>
<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
<p><strong>What is this</strong> - I just don't think this is a strong use case overall. This is not something that you do daily, weekly, or even monthly. Maybe once a year or so. The last time I did it was last year in Mexico to know the name of an animal that was nearby. I went to Google and looked for "Mexico animal that looks like a racoon" and the first answer was Coati which was what I was looking for. If that query didn't work, I would have taken a picture of the animal and then Google search - but that's my second choice because of the effort of doing so. This to say that it's not really a pain point that users will have.</p>
<p><strong>Edit spreadsheet</strong> - This is a somewhat interesting use case choice, I wonder if they picked it up because no other device showed being capable of doing this (taking a picture to a handwritten table, asking for a change and emailing the image to your email). Personally, I don't write tables that much anymore on paper, and the ones I do are small enough that if I want to transcribe it takes me seconds to do. It may be a strong use case for certain jobs, but I’m not sure about it, nor the performance it would have on large tables. The example Jesse shared at the event was a 5x3 tabl.</p>
<h3 id="terminal-mode">Terminal mode</h3>
<p>It’s like using ChatGPT but with a worse interface. The keyboard reminds me of BlackBerry but it’s gimmicky to use - personally, I didn’t like the experience. I would always pick up my phone to use ChatGPT over using the Terminal mode for instance.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_3.png"></p>
<h3 id="translation">Translation</h3>
<p>YES. Having Portuguese parents that don’t speak english, whenever they are with my wife, I need to be the translator. So having a device that allows them to translate in “real-time” both ways is a huge value add.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that Google already has this feature - but it's shit and if you disagree, you never actually used it. LLMs can understand expression and meaning, in a way that a model like BERT cannot. I actually did this post where I prompted ChatGPT to do exactly this - act as a device that stays in the middle of a conversation translating from one language to another based on who the speaker was (tweet <a href="https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1740049615804846461">here</a>, it went kind of viral).</p>
<p>Sure, this could be an app, but I quite like the idea of having a device that just does this. I think that’s because the translation works both ways, so I imagine you passing the device to the other person to press the button when they want to speak. So that way, it feels more like a “common” object whereas your phone is more personal.</p>
<p>Although I was excited about this, and it was the first thing I tried it failed badly. The CTO of the company <a href="https://x.com/LiaoPeiyuan/status/1783001793573843078">replied</a> to <a href="https://x.com/didier_lopes/status/1783000272278569412">my tweet</a> saying that they are working on fixing it.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_4.png"></p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>Yay, another note-taking app. NOT. I’d prefer an integration with the Apple Notes app or Notion, so I don’t need to then go into yet another website and copy-paste those notes to some other place.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_5.png"></p>
<h3 id="voice-recording">Voice Recording</h3>
<p>The voice recording feature is pretty good. If you are a content creator (e.g., writer, youtuber), I think this is very powerful. The way I see it is that rabbit offers way less distractions than your phone, so you could go on a walk and take r1 and just speak with it to brainstorm ideas. Then go to the website and analyze your ideas to transform it into content.</p>
<p>Personally, when I have ideas like this I just drop a voice note to my wife’s WhatsApp and then mark the message as unread. It’s hacky but it works and I've been doing it for a long time now. We have an inside joke where I start these audios with “Note to self” and she always makes fun of it.</p>
<div class="flex justify-center gap-2"><img src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_6.png" width="50%"><img src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_7.png" width="50%"></div>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Last year for my birthday my wife gave me a <a href="https://divoom.com/products/divoom-pro">Divoom Ditoo-Pro Retro</a> - it does a lot of things (e.g. music, radio, alarm, voice memo, games, music, planner, pixel art). Honestly, I just use it for music. It lived in my car during the entire year as a speaker since I didn't have bluetooth audio in the car. I think the advantage of rabbit r1 over it is that I can use my voice to change the music, which is handy if you are driving. On the other hand, my Divoom allows me to listen to my audibles since it acts as a bluetooth speaker whereas rabbit r1 would need an audible integration.</p>
<p>I think this can be a compelling use case as sitting in the middle of the table at a dinner or party with friends, where if someone wants to change the music they can just use the rabbit r1 to ask for something - and this way you can keep your phone/laptop on you instead of using it for everybody else to touch.</p>
<h3 id="apps">Apps</h3>
<p><strong>Doordash/Uber</strong> - I haven’t tried it yet, but I feel like the phone is so good at it already and with a rich UI/UX, that I don’t see the point in using rabbit r1.</p>
<p><strong>Generative AI</strong> - This is an interesting use case. Personally I don’t use Midjourney so I'm not the target audience. I do find it interesting that you can generate these images on the go on r1 directly without having to go through Discord (suboptimal) experience. I'm excited about the opportunities that this presents - for instance, integrating with <a href="https://openbb.co/products/bot">OpenBB Bot</a> to display financial data on rabbit r1 directly.</p>
<h3 id="teach-mode">Teach mode</h3>
<p>Jesse showed a brief preview of how teach mode works but mentioned that this feature is not yet available and they want to nail the user experience and add guardrails so users cannot use it for something malicious. I'm very excited about the teach mode prospect, since I think this falls in the category of "app creation" and allows users to use the device for very specific needs, hence opening the total addressable market.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>First of all, the rabbit r1 is beautiful. It's light, well made and has this bright appealing color. This isn't surprising since it was done in collaboration with <a href="https://teenage.engineering/">Teenage Engineering</a> (a company known for making products that I want without knowing what they do).</p>
<p>This may be controversial, but the thing I like the least about the hardware is the button being located on the right side. The reason why I hate that decision is that I cannot easily use the device with one hand only. If I try, it becomes very gimmicky where I do gymnastics just to press the button. I don't get why they didn't make it right under the scrolling wheel, it would resemble more a controller/phone which is something that our hands have long been accustomed to. Even if the button was located on the upper side of the device, the UX would be MUCH better.</p>
<p>That's one of my biggest complaints against the hardware itself, see image below to see what I mean. I almost need to bend my right thumb in order to reach the button which is used very often. One can argue that I can wrap my hands more around the device to give a better experiencing in clicking the button which is 100% true, HOWEVER, if I do that then I can't reach the wheel to scroll.</p>

<br>
<p>Also, related with the picture from the above. The battery is pretty weak, it needs to be charged often.</p>
<p>The rabbit r1 OS has a lot of room for improvement, a few things I've experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a black screen that doesn't recover until I manually power off device;</li>
<li>Not triggering the function I want - sometimes it looks for a specific wording, e.g. "start a recording session" works but "do a voice recording" does not. I would have expected for it to be able to understand intent;</li>
<li>Sometimes I get a "The app is under maintenance. Please try again later" for functions that I know it is capable of doing;</li>
<li>Every few minutes getting "unable to connect to Rabbit OS";</li>
<li>Randomly losing the previous context - I assume this is because of the number of tokens that can fit in the context?;</li>
<li>Spotify integration broken;</li>
<li>Even though it knows my location (due to getting weather app location correct), the time is not correct and I can't update it through the settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is also the first product version and LLMs are by nature non-deterministic so these type of bugs are kind of expected.</p>
<p>It's a one-time $199 price tag. There's no recurring subscription. As a consumer, I like this a lot. A one-time purchase allows users to buy the product to experiment without any strong commitment (apart from that one-time fee of course). In terms of economics, I'm not sure how Rabbit will handle a growing user base and better LLMs. During the event, they mentioned a partnership with both OpenAI and Anthropic. If they are using one of these models, someone needs to be paying for these tokens. For instance, for <a href="https://openbb.co/products/pro">OpenBB Terminal Pro</a> we decided to allow usage similarly to how the ChatGPT free tier works, which basically rate limits based on usage and allows us to keep our costs controlled.</p>
<p>Meta is attempting to commoditize LLMs, so if I were in rabbit's shoes I would consider hosting <a href="https://llama.meta.com/llama3/">Llama 3</a> locally and providing inference from this directly. Maybe even do a partnership with <a href="https://groq.com/">Groq</a> for users paying a small subscription - not so much because of the impressive 800 tokens/s inference (using Llama 3) since rabbit r1 uses voice and inference speed is less relevant, but for the cold start (i.e. the lag between user question and output). Meta's commercial license only applies to companies with over 700 Million active users, so I think Rabbit would be good for some time.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn’t recommend rabbit r1 as a phone alternative. Not even close. If someone says that they stopped using their phone after having their rabbit r1, I can guarantee you that they weren’t using their phone a lot anyway. I agree a lot with MKBHD in saying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA">Phones are OP</a>.</p>
<p>But if you are reading this, you are probably wondering what are the use cases where I would recommend Rabbit r1. So let's do that.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-a-buy-if">This is a buy if</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For kids that are curious and want to learn more about the world. Being able to have it before a phone, is very compelling. Imagine your kid being able to ask r1 what a word means and how to use it in a sentence, who person X is, how something works, to practice learning another language, as a complement when reading a book/studying. The advantage over the phone is that it doesn't have any other distractions. It would basically be Perplexity on the go, and thus the Perplexity tagline "Where knowledge begins" makes total sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a device for two-way translation. The two-way is important, because if it’s just one-way then using the phone is preferred. But being two-way allows for both people to interact with the device, which in my opinion is less personal than a phone and more like a gadget. We aren't there yet, but I'm sure the model will keep improving and becoming better at this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For content creators who want to “zone out” and leave their phone at home and just use the record feature to record content, whether that is a blog post, a new lyrics or a podcast idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a music device to be at the center of a table at a dinner, in the corner at a party selecting the tunes or on a roadtrip. People will enjoy interacting with it due to its unique nature, and that way you don't need to be blocked from using your phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a virtual assistant. If the alarm feature was already implemented, I would've likely already replace my Alexa, since rabbit r1 looks much nicer. Even more with the cool standing case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>... and of course, the use case is worth $200 for you. There are likely devices that can achieve the same for a cheaper cost. I like the fact that is state-of-the-art and they are trying to innovate.</p>
<p>Also, the rabbit effect going up and down waiting to be prompted and the hears going up when listening is pretty sweet - see it <a target="_blank" data-nobrokenlinkcheck="true" href="https://didierlopes.com/assets/files/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_10-7f8ddd0aa7943163b831fe104197e46a.png">here</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, there are two recurring topics in these use cases, so let's talk about each individually.</p>
<h3 id="main-use-cases">Main use cases</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>A very targeted use case</strong> - The phone can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it's your door to the world and what's happening. On the other hand, it's your door to the world and what's happening. I say it this way because this can be extremely good or bad depending on the use case. Phones are optimized for users to spend time on them, apps are optimized to provide dopamine hits so users use them for longer. Notifications will interrupt you throughout the day so you remember to go back to the app, etc.. But sometimes you only want to do 1 thing, and don't want to be distracted from it. The best example are E-Books. You can read on your phone, iPad or laptop - yet people decide to buy a kindle so they can just do that. Read with no distractions. You are paying a premium for a product to remove the distractions. I believe that rabbit r1 can achieve this, particularly if they allow developers to build specific apps for specific use cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gadget to be used by multiple people</strong> (examples above: two-way translation or music device) - The phone has become a very personal device over the years. If someone gets access to your phone unlocked they have access to who you are (important emails, personal photos, chat conversations, the apps you use and how do you spend your time, the songs you listen or books you read, even confidential documents). So, there are certain scenarios where you don't want to borrow your phone to someone to do something, since that requires trust that they won't see anything that is confidential. I think Rabbit r1 can go after this category because its a shiny gadget that doesn't really hold any personal information from the user, and this way allows the user to keep their phone in their pocket while using rabbit r1 for some tasks that the phone could also do but would require for others to have access to it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h2 id="excited-about">Excited about</h2>
<h3 id="developer-ecosystem">Developer Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Apple became Apple not because of their revolutionary LCD screen without a keyboard, but because of the developer ecosystem they created. The iPhone became stickier over time, because there were more apps being built on top of it that users could easily tap into. It also allowed Apple to generate revenue from the monetization of these apps.</p>
<p>I truly hope that this is the direction that Jesse and team want to take. If I were in their shoes, I would prioritize that over any other feature. Just allow developers to create apps (in this case functions) that the LAM can call to do something very specific.</p>
<p>Instead of having their team working on all these features, create the foundational marketplace that allows developers to do so. Start by only allowing free apps and see what developers are building and what users are utilizing. Then move to allow developers to monetize and take a cut from it. And allow users to decide what apps are enabled within their devices and which ones aren't - show which apps are the most downloaded and used and link it to a user profile. Make it so that the user profile needs to be a rabbit r1 holder to avoid scams..</p>
<p>A few examples: Someone building a Pokedex app for animals, you take r1 to the zoo and just take a picture of the animals with it, then you go home and look into your pokedex. Or a Pokedex for travel monuments. Or integrating OpenBB so I could do research on-the-go.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-04-28-rabbit-r1-there-is-hope_12.png"></p>
<h3 id="native-ai-phone">Native AI-phone</h3>
<p><a href="https://us.nothing.tech/">Nothing</a> has one of the best consumer tech brands out there. If the Apple ecosystem wasn't as sticky as it is today, I would buy one. Both Nothing and Rabbit are very unique brands, and I think a partnership between them could be a game-changer.</p>
<p>I'm imagining a Native AI-phone built on Android with rabbit's LAM. So, in simple terms, it would be like Nothing Phone (2) but it would have an r1 button that you can use to interact with it through voice instead of fingers. The challenge would be combining the LAM from rabbit r1 to all the apps that Nothing Phone (2) provides - but I believe in a future where applications will be built not only thinking about how humans will utilize them but also LLMs - at least <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-agents">we are doing that at OpenBB</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal">OpenBB Platform</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack_1.png"></p>
<p>How I built a financial analyst that lives on Slack and has access to OpenBB.</p>
<p>The open source code is available <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-slack-agent">here</a>.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>At OpenBB, we have the tradition of hosting an internal Creaton on the penultimate week of the year.</p>
<p>The OpenBB Creaton is our creative Hackathon, where every team member picks a project to work on throughout the week and gets fully focused on it. The only rule is that it relies on OpenBB technology.</p>
<p>It’s a way for us to get further contact with our technology, but it also allows us to create proofs-of-concept of products/features that we may invest in the feature. Think of it as an R&amp;D week.</p>
<p>We do it then because our team members get the last week of the year as time off. So, if they want to present their project to the rest of the team in January, they can also use that time to wrap up.</p>
<h2 id="my-project">My Project</h2>
<p>At the Open Core Summit III, I presented a way of creating an AI-powered financial analyst capable of handling complex financial queries.</p>
<p>I wrote more about this in this <a href="https://didierlopes.com/blog/creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst">blog post</a>. This robust architecture can access 100+ financial datasets from OpenBB tools and reason about them. The code is open source here.</p>
<p>I shared how our AI-powered financial analyst was able to answer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Check what TSLA peers are. From those, check which one has the highest market cap. Then, for the ticker that has the highest market cap, get the most recent price target estimate from an analyst, and tell me who it was and on what date the estimate was made.”</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Perform a fundamentals financial analysis of AMZN using the most recently available data. What do you find that’s interesting?”</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Since that was already working so well (watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-43EKK2PhE&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https://openbb.co/blog/creating-an-ai-powered-financial-analyst&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE">presentation video here</a>), I wanted to bring these capabilities to Slack, show that this could be the future, and prove it would impact every analyst job.</p>
<p>That’s when Goh Analyst was born.</p>

<p>Note: Goh Analyst together is GOHANalyst, which is why the image is Gohan from Dragon Ball with the OpenBB logo on his forehead.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>To get started, you can see the <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/openbb-slack-agent/tree/main">open-source repository and instructions</a>.</p>
<p>First, I forked the <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-agents">open-source code of the OpenBB agents repository</a> that we have been using for R&amp;D. This repository contains all the code for the OpenBB agent and has access to 100+ financial datasets.</p>
<p>Then, I modified it to my needs:</p>
<p>Created the Slack bot interface</p>
<p>When a Slack message mentions @Gohanalyst this workflow gets triggered</p>
<p>When the Slack message contains the word “OpenBB”, I send that message through the OpenBB agent since the assumption is that data retrieval will be necessary. Otherwise, it goes straight through OpenAI.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, this is what the architecture looks like:</p>
<p align="center"><img width="800" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack_3.png"></p>
<p>I made Goh Analyst slightly sarcastic to make it a bit more fun. This makes interacting in a public channel somewhat more human and exciting. It can handle simple financial questions, retrieve data using OpenBB tools, or even answer more complex reasoning questions.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="800" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack_4.png"></p>

<p>Now imagine that every organization has an analyst on their Slack to help make decisions.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's next</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, one of the advantages we get from OpenBB Creaton is that we test our products and give feedback to the team on what went well or less well. After working on this project, this is what I shared with the team:</p>

<p>Exciting times we live in. If you want to leverage AI within your financial firm, we can help you 🤝</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-28-goh-analyst-the-ai-powered-financial-analyst-who-lives-on-slack.png"></p>
<p>I have started a company. I have moved countries. It turns out that there's a lot in common between these.</p>
<br>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>Recently, I wrote a blogpost about the <a href="https://didierlopes.com/blog/moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed">difference in culture between London and San Francisco</a>. I convinced my wife and dogs, packed our bags, and didn't look back. After all, I would live in the city with the highest density of builders per capita.</p>
<p><strong>But why?</strong></p>
<p>Most of my friends and family didn't understand why I would leave London. I liked the city, I enjoyed my lifestyle, I had friends, I played football with the same group every week, had dinner at the same restaurants, was close to family, and wouldn't be able to save money.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, this move didn't make any sense. No one really told me that I was doing the right thing, but internally, I knew I had to.</p>
<p>I believe this isn't so different from creating a startup. This blog post will explain what they have in common and why I did it.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-startup--deciding-to-leave-yourcountry">Creating a startup / Deciding to leave your&nbsp;country</h2>
<p><a href="http://eladgil.com/">Elad Gil</a> wrote a really good <a href="https://blog.eladgil.com/p/startups-are-an-act-of-desperation">article</a> on how creating a startup is an act of desperation. I believe that post could be equally applicable to moving countries, so I will list the same points used by Elad in the context of moving countries and provide examples. Most of the time, the person moving countries has a mix of the below bullet points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Career desperation.</strong> Startups allow people early or stuck in their careers to jump a few steps ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>This applies equally to moving, and is why I left Portugal to pursue an MSc at Imperial College London.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Financial desperation.</strong> If successful, a startup will also leapfrog you financially.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>This is the biggest motivation for people to move countries. This is why I was born in Switzerland, even though my parents are Portuguese. Having blue-collar jobs, they emigrated to a country with a better economy to provide my brother and me with a better life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Product or mission desperation.</strong> The other reason startups often exist is that the founders are desperate for a product to exist in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>In this case, it's the equivalent of hearing about Silicon Valley in documentaries or watching Steve Jobs presenting the iPhone in 2007. You cannot ignore that as an engineer, so you are desperate to move to be part of that tech scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Desperation to do something big or important, and to avoid wasted time.</strong> Some people want to "make a dent in the universe" and are motivated by doing something useful with their lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>This is what the "American dream" is all about. People moved to the US to do something bigger than themselves and achieve the promised dream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revenge vs the Arena</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>The equivalent to this is when someone returns to their home country after several years outside with more wealth and/or experience.</p>
<h2 id="growing-a-startup--livingabroad">Growing a startup / Living&nbsp;abroad</h2>
<h3 id="mission-andvision">Mission and&nbsp;Vision</h3>
<p>When creating a company, you must have a clear mission and vision. This allows you to create a community/team that will be with you for the long run. Similarly, when moving countries, it's essential to have a well-defined goal. This doesn't mean that the goal cannot change; after all, companies pivot. However, you need to have a strategy that you follow until you don't.</p>
<h3 id="risk-and-uncertainty">Risk and Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Startups and moving to a new country both involve stepping into the unknown. Entrepreneurs often take financial and personal risks, while those moving countries leave behind familiar surroundings, support systems, and sometimes even their careers. Uncertainty becomes a constant companion, demanding adaptability, problem-solving skills, and the ability to embrace change with open arms.</p>
<h3 id="cultural-integration-and-networking">Cultural Integration and Networking</h3>
<p>Building a successful startup requires networking, forming strategic partnerships, and understanding the market. Similarly, when moving countries, one must navigate cultural differences, learn new languages, and establish a network of contacts. Expanding social circles, building relationships, and immersing oneself in the local culture contribute to personal growth and enhance professional opportunities, just like in the startup world.</p>
<h3 id="resilience-and-persistence">Resilience and Persistence</h3>
<p>Building a startup and moving countries demands unwavering resilience and persistence in facing challenges. Startups encounter setbacks, pivots, and failures, but successful entrepreneurs persist and learn from their experiences. Similarly, moving countries can bring unexpected hurdles, such as language barriers, difficulties making friends, challenges adapting to a new culture, or not finding a routine. Embracing these challenges with determination and adaptability paves the way for growth and achievement.</p>
<h3 id="learning-andgrowth">Learning and&nbsp;Growth</h3>
<p>Startups and moving countries are transformative experiences that offer immense personal and professional growth opportunities. Entrepreneurs continuously learn from their successes and failures in the startup world, refining their strategies and acquiring new skills. Likewise, moving countries provides a unique chance to learn about different cultures, broaden perspectives, and develop resilience, patience, and empathy. Both experiences foster personal development and shape individuals into more well-rounded and adaptable individuals.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-doit">Why did I do&nbsp;it?</h2>
<p>The reason why I started OpenBB and also moved country is a combination of 2 factors:</p>
<h3 id="product-or-mission-desperation">Product or mission desperation.</h3>
<p>On a startup level, I have experienced the need for an open-source investment research platform. That's why I wanted to create this platform, which was yet to exist. I think it wouldn't be possible if I didn't dedicate my time to it. This is why OpenBB's success is so important-it will enable millions of investors to have better access to data and better understand the financial market.</p>
<p>Growing up as an engineer fascinated by tech and innovation, the US has always been home to the biggest companies and hottest products. I've always been attracted to Silicon Valley, but before OpenBB, I never had the chance to. The first job I applied to after finishing university was Waymo in CA, but they didn't sponsor VISAs for that role.</p>
<h3 id="desperation-to-do-something-big-or-important">Desperation to do something big or important.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>On a startup level, I want to work on something bigger than myself. I want to solve a problem that no one has solved before and build something useful for millions of people that can withstand time.</p>
<p>I will do whatever it takes to build the first truly open-source investment research platform. Moving to SF increased my network opportunities with other entrepreneurs and builders from whom I can learn. I want to be fully immersed in this ecosystem and give it my all to do everything possible to help OpenBB succeed as a company, regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p>Note: A few weeks ago, I moved to NYC because I truly believe living here would increase the chances of OpenBB's success compared to living in SF.</p>]]></content>

<p>The culture shock from moving to the Bay Area from London.</p>
<br>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>A few months ago, I wrote a blogpost about what was needed in order for my wife and our 2 dogs to move to the Bay Area from London. You can check that blog post <a href="https://didierlopes.com/blog/leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve had some people asking me after living in the Bay for 1 year, what are the biggest differences I’ve experienced in terms of lifestyle &amp; culture.</p>
<p>I will write a section below for each of the major topics I experienced. Note that this is based on my experience, and you may disagree/have different opinions than me on some of these - which are very welcome.</p>
<h2 id="living-costs">Living costs</h2>
<p>Back in 2016 when I was at university, in Portugal, I used to pay 200 euros/month to live in an apartment with a roommate. My university cost was 800 euros/year and my parents gave me a monthly allowance of 300 euros/month to pay for food and anything else. I didn’t do many activities and would rarely go out, so I was able to live comfortably on that.</p>
<p>Once I moved to London (in 2017) to pursue a MSc. at Imperial College I was paying 1.6k £/month for a studio in Earl’s Court. This was walking distance from Imperial (didn’t have to pay for transportation) and was cheaper than the accommodations that the university offered. The university was no longer 800 euros/year, it cost £11k for the entire MSc (1 year).</p>
<p>So there was a shock that I experienced in terms of living costs from Lisbon to London.</p>
<p>Once I decided to move to the Bay Area (2023) I knew that the living costs were going to be higher, but in my head “how higher can these be?”.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Apparently, a lot.</p>
<h3 id="shopping">Shopping</h3>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_1.png"></p>
<p>This was the first shopping trip I had in the Bay (Whole foods is the equivalent to Waitrose in London, I often still confuse them and my wife finds it funny - anyway, they call it whole paycheck here bc $$$). These 10 items cost me $69.34. I couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Costco is arguably my favorite shop. It’s like a better IKEA. We would spend at least 2 hours shopping but we would get supplies for 3 weeks, the famous hot dog/pizza combo and put gas in the car. The membership (120$/year) pays itself really fast at Costco. The main downside is that since we were only 2 and I hate throwing food out, it happened a few times that I had to adapt my meals to make sure no food would go to waste. E.g. Eat a guacamole pack a day since the smaller pack brings 24 and it there were 24 days until the expiry date.</p>
<p>PS: I like Costco so much that I always took the friends/family who visited to it, as if it was an attraction. Sometimes we would even go directly to Costco from the airport, to breathe in Costco and all its magnificence upon arrival <!-- -->:D</p>
<p align="center" class="flex items-center gap-2 justify-center"><img width="300" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_2.png"><img width="300" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_3.png"></p>
<h3 id="apartment">Apartment</h3>
<p>Since I went to the US with the sole purpose of working hard and making OpenBB successful, I ended up picking a nice apartment in San Mateo - given that we spend 90% of our time at home. Our monthly rent for a 2-bedroom flat was 4.4k $/month with everything included (including both dogs rent, lol).</p>
<p>The apartment had a small gym, a common pool &amp; bbq area and an outdoor hot tub. But more importantly, it was located right by 101, walking distance from Peets &amp; Starbucks and very pet friendly. In addition, I was 40m from SF, 10m from the airport and 20m from Palo Alto. This meant that we were in a very calm area whilst being close to the most important hubs.</p>
<p>The common pool and BBQ area (+ the sunny weather) were insane, sometimes I wish I had spent more time there. But I guess you tend to value things more when you don’t have them :)</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_4.png"></p>
<h3 id="tipping-culture">Tipping culture</h3>
<p>In Europe, I very very rarely tipped. Not just me, but all people I know. It’s just not part of our culture. Everything is factored in. Even in London, most restaurants will have a “service charge” which is kind of a tip BUT it’s included in the bill and so you don’t need to think about how much you are going to tip.</p>
<p>In the US, if you don’t tip - people will judge you. The system is done in a way that tipping is not a “should” but closer to a “must”. Workers rely on your tips when thinking about their total compensation. And now I understand why my friends who work in restaurants/cafes enjoy Americans so much, it’s because they bring their tipping culture to Europe and so that extra money is very meaningful for European folks.</p>
<p>Some rules that I follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I go to a coffee shop and just do takeaway, I don’t tip. If I sit down in a table, then I tip between 15-20%.</li>
<li>When in a restaurant, I always tip. But the percentage varies based on the quality of the service and food. If I didn’t like it, I still tip 10%. If I really enjoy it then I tip 20%. If it was just good, I do 15%. This is a rule of thumb. In practice, I do this but then round to a multiple of $5 because yes (this is the equivalent to my wife not allowing odd numbers as the TV volume).</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to get used to this is to just internally assume that 20% extra cost on whatever you are seeing on the menu. If a burger + drink costs $30, assume it will be $36 after taxes and tip.</p>
<p>Note that in restaurants they expect you to leave your credit card on the top of the bill. This is so they can “freeze” the bill and once they bring the receipt back they will wait for you to add the amount for the tip (+ total). Once you fill this and sign (in theory, the signing is mandatory) - only then they will be able to withdraw the bill amount + the tip.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_5.png"></p>
<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
<p>Growing up in Portugal I used to watch every Benfica game and then in high school you would talk about the games you watched during the weekend. There was no other sport, it was a binary - either you are a soccer fan or you don’t watch any sports at all. When I moved to London, this changed slightly, there were people that liked other sports but Soccer was still the main sport by a very big margin. People would fill up a pub to watch Soccer only - maybe the other sport that came closest was Cricket.</p>
<p>In the US, people don’t really care about Soccer. It feels like it’s a sport that kids do, but adults don’t really talk about it or watch it. They know about Messi/Ronaldo, but aren’t really fans. On the other hand, American football, Basketball and Baseball are very big. Aquatic pole also seems to be popular in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>I remember when we got the apartment, I was walking my dogs and there was a soccer pitch nearby. I was super happy because I thought that I could do what I used to do in London and just show up to the ground on the weekend and do a pick-up play with random folks. Unfortunately, after several attempts of walking nearby I realized that the pitch was only used for kids to play soccer and never adults. In London, on a sunny day, it’s hard (maybe impossible?) to find a soccer field empty.</p>
<p align="center" class="flex items-center gap-2 justify-center"><img width="300" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_6.png"><img width="300" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_7.png"></p>
<h3 id="college-sports">College sports</h3>
<p>While in Europe in general, no one cares about college sports. The reality in the US is completely different. Not only do they fill their stadiums with 50k+ people, but these games bring a TON of money. People will literally sit outside the stadium in the morning and wait for the time of the match. It’s called tailgating.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_8.png"></p>
<p>I’ve noticed that some people don’t even go to the stadium, they just sit outside the stadium watching the game in the car park on their TV and drinking. I still don’t fully get why you would do that, but I guess it’s a tradition.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_9.png"></p>
<h2 id="working-culture">Working Culture</h2>
<p>My plan was to live in the US for the duration of my visa (O-1) and then return after 3 years. But the working culture is the reason why I hope to stay for longer. Most people you will meet in the Bay work very hard. They don’t finish the day at 5/6pm but do long hours to get shit done. What motivates them is building the future and being part of something bigger than themselves.</p>
<p>In London, I felt like the culture was very strong towards finishing your working day and going to the pub at 5/6pm - get drunk. And then repeat. Before London I didn’t drink alcohol, and in London I started drinking sometimes to socialize. In the Bay I feel like there isn’t an expectation that everyone wants to drink, and people leave events early because they want to head home to work on something - which is something I used to do back in London.</p>
<p>I also feel like in the Bay Area, when you go to events you can talk about what you are working on without people judging you for bringing “work” into the conversation. And I tend to find these conversations more interesting. In London, there’s less emphasis in tech, and the interests tend to be a bit broader: music, arts, history, etc..</p>
<p>While people say that London is a big hub for startups &amp; founders, I didn’t find this to be the case. In the Bay Area, the likelihood of you encountering someone on the street and them working at a startup (most of the time their own) is really high. You can even feel the strength of this tech community on Twitter, whereas that doesn’t exist (AFAIK) in London.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_10.png"></p><p>Elad Gil fireside with Satya Nadella at Stripe's HQ</p><p></p>
<h3 id="equity-as-part-of-compensation-package">Equity as part of compensation package</h3>
<p>Most European startups do not offer any equity. In the Bay Area, all startups offer equity. The earlier you join (higher risk) the more meaningful the options you get are. One of the reasons this works is because US employees are, in general, hard-working and will go the long way for their company. So this makes it so that incentives are aligned, and employees want to work harder because that equity can become much more meaningful than their base salary (potentially life-changing).</p>
<p>One of the reasons this works so well is that pretty much every US person knows someone in firsthand who made f-u money by selling their shares in secondaries, or has at least heard stories about this. While I was in the UK, before starting OpenBB, I didn’t hear about this once. Also because companies have no interest in offering you equity if they don’t have to.</p>
<p>E.g. at my previous startup I used to stay working late into the night, because in my perspective this would increase the startup's chances of success. However, I had no equity. So this meant that if the startup was wildly successful, I would have no direct gains from it and the company would not owe me anything. Offering equity through a typical 4-year vesting schedule (with 1-year cliff) provides the perfect type of alignment.</p>
<h3 id="holidays">Holidays</h3>
<p>The amount of holidays is a good example that demonstrates the hard-working culture that so well characterizes the US. In the US they are used to having 2-weeks off in a full calendar year. In London, most companies offer at least 4-weeks, which is effectively 2x the number of holidays.</p>
<h2 id="driving-culture">Driving culture</h2>
<p>The London underground works impressively, I lived there for 5 years and never once even considered owning a car.</p>
<p>I thought I could do the same in the US and people were being dramatic. That thought lasted maybe 2 days?</p>
<p>On the first day I had to go to Fedex which was a 15-20m walk, and when I told the apartment administrator that I was going to walk there she looked at me like I was crazy and said “you need to take your car”. After walking there I understood what she meant and that unless you are in a city, the pedestrian sidewalks/roads just aren’t prepared for pedestrians.</p>
<h3 id="differences">Differences</h3>
<ul>
<li>You drive on the right (x2) side of the road. Since I didn’t drive in the UK, this was very easy for me as I’m used to driving in Portugal where we also drive on the right side of the road.</li>
<li>In the UK (or Europe, in general) having more than 3 lanes on the highway is atypical. In the US, having 6 lanes it’s considered normal. Sometimes it’s tricky and you can’t be in the most right side because the 2 right lanes may both exit and thus you need to hop over 2 lanes to keep on the same route. This mistake can be costly.</li>
<li>There are very very few roundabouts in the Bay. There are a LOT of intersections. I like it less (not because I think it’s slower) but because it’s more “boring” to wait for the green light and from my point of view, people are more likely to grab their phone during that time because they don’t need to pay as much attention, at least compared to a roundabout where you are waiting for an opening to keep moving. (there are so few roundabouts that the first time I saw one I took a picture to share with my wife)</li>
<li>There’s a “Right on Red” policy. This means that if you are at an intersection and it’s red for you to proceed if there’s no incoming car from the left side you can turn right on the red. I like this because it allows for traffic to flow better. My wife doesn’t like it because as a pedestrian sometimes cars start accelerating and don’t respect pedestrian as much. Nonetheless, I love to make this joke when people from Europe visit, where I say that I’m going to pass a red and they are shocked when they see me turning right on a red light.</li>
<li>In the Bay they have FastTrack which allows people to pay to use the most-left lane and avoid traffic. Although this is capitalist I like it because if I’m in a rush I can pay a few dollars to avoid the congestion - it’s a type of SaaS - Speed as a Service 😄</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="waymo">Waymo</h3>
<p>Waymo, a self-driving car division that started off Google, was the first startup I applied to when I finished university. I have been bullish on self-driving cars since university - my dissertation was on that topic and I had to propose it myself, since there were no proposals for such. So seeing Waymo operating in SF was mind-blowing to me.</p>
<p>Autonomous cars are a matter of time - and SF (and the Bay Area) being the city where Waymo starts operating, shows a lot about how progressive this city is. I recommend everyone to try one out.</p>
<p>My dad, someone who was born and raised in a small town in Portugal, and who understands very little about technology seeing this was something. Him seated in the passenger’s seat for the full 16 min drive recording a wheel with no driver and ending the journey telling me “I never thought I would see this in my life, thank you” is something that no amount of money in this world could buy.</p>

<h3 id="driving-license">Driving license</h3>
<p>Even though I have a Portuguese driving license since I was 18. That’s only accepted for 10 days or so - and if you have an international driving license for it to work for longer (I didn’t go this route). So I had to apply for a California Driving License (CDL) which meant taking a written exam and doing a driving test.</p>
<p>The written exam was actually fairly easy compared to the one I had in Portugal. In the Bay, the test consists of 36 multiple-choice questions, and you are allowed to fail up to 6 questions.  In Portugal I had 30 multiple-choice questions and could only fail up to 3.</p>
<p>I found the written exam to be easy after doing multiple practice tests online. Most of the questions ended up being somewhat similar to the ones I had practiced the day before.</p>
<p>Doing the written exam was very different though. In Portugal we did it in a closed room with someone watching us and everyone else in silence. In the Bay Area I did it in a corner of the DMV with a lot of background noise behind me. I had to use both my hands to cover my ears to be able to focus, which was annoying.</p>
<p>The driving exam is much easier than the one I did in Portugal. It lasted for maybe 20-25 minutes and it was just around the DMV. When doing it in Portugal, the test lasts 40 minutes and includes: parallel parking, reversing while tracking a curb (without touching it), stopping in a hill (harder when driving with a stick), roundabout and highway.</p>
<p>Also, the DMV is as bad as they say it is. This movie scene is pretty accurate:</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_13.png"></p>
<h2 id="cards">Cards</h2>
<p>In the US, as in the UK, the driving license acts as citizen card. Even if you don’t drive it’s worth getting your drivers license since everywhere you go that is used for you to prove who you are.</p>
<p>When doing anything official in the UK, you get asked about your passport (and the passport number). That ID is all they need to recognize who you are. In the US you have a Social Security Number (SSN) which is this super-confidential number that you are meant to keep secret, yet they keep asking you about it when you rent an apartment, set up a phone plan, go to the doctor, buy a car, … It’s a weird concept. The difference is that in the UK if someone gets your passport number, nothing really happens. In the US if someone gets your SSN, it can be used to commit fraud, open new credit and bank accounts, obtain employment, and access medical care or other benefits.</p>
<h3 id="debit-vs-credit-card">Debit vs credit card</h3>
<p>In Portugal and the UK, I only had a Debit card which had access to all the cash in the bank. When moving to the Bay Area, everyone told me to get a credit card and leave the debit card at home. There are a lot of scams in the US, and having a credit card is safer since banks limit the withdrawal amounts based on your credit score and will protect in case of theft.</p>
<p>In the UK, there isn’t a concept of a credit score - at least publicly. Banks will have something like that based on how on time you pay for things, but it’s only used internally for loans or others. In the US, everything revolves around your credit score. The amount of money you can withdraw from your credit card, the loans you get, the apartments you can rent, … so it’s important to pay everything on time and avoid debt.</p>
<h2 id="employment">Employment</h2>
<p>Employment in the US is very different from the one in the UK.</p>
<p>In the UK, you get paid a value at the end of the month that corresponds to the value you take home and the employer handles both your Income taxes and the National insurance (which goes to the NHS).</p>
<p>In the US, you need to handle your taxes at the end of a fiscal year. There are multiple taxes applied and hence it’s not as simple as the tax system that exists in the UK.</p>
<p>In addition, there isn’t a public “free” NHS (healthcare) in the United States. As an individual, you need to select the plan you are interested in (based on a few choices that your employer offers you). Hence you need to consider not only what the monthly premium entails, but how the deductible works - and as weird as it sounds you need to “estimate” your likelihood of getting into an accident to select something that works for you. This is hard to grasp coming from a country where there’s “free” healthcare and everyone has access to the same services.</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<h3 id="student-debt">Student debt</h3>
<p>In Portugal, the concept of student debt doesn’t really exist. In general, parents pay their kids' tuition. This is possible because the tuition costs for public universities aren’t very high.</p>
<p>In the UK, students tend to have student debt since university costs can be rather expensive (e.g. around 10k pounds/year).</p>
<p>In the US, student debt is much higher. We are talking about starting a career with 300k in student loans, which is absolutely wild.</p>
<h3 id="phone-plan">Phone plan</h3>
<p>While I was paying around 8 pounds/month for my UK phone plan with unlimited data. For a similar plan in the US, the cost is around 70 $/month. A funny story about this is when I bought my phone plan, they told me that the cost was 70$ for their cheapest plan and I thought they meant yearly. When they told me it was monthly, I had to call my co-founder to make sure this wasn’t a rip-off. To which he said: “Welcome to the US”.</p>
<h3 id="guns--alcohol">Guns &amp; Alcohol</h3>
<p>In the UK (and Europe in general), it’s illegal to own a gun and you can start drinking at 18 years old. In the US, you can buy a gun as soon as you are 18 but aren’t allowed to drink until 21.</p>
<p>And also, Kinder Surprise is illegal in the US because of the toy that comes inside. So you can’t buy a chocolate with a toy inside because you can choke on it, but can go to the store to buy a gun.</p>

<h3 id="dog-parks">Dog Parks</h3>
<p>One of my all-time favorite things in the US and that Europe in general should learn from. The US has a LOT of dog parks. These are spaces that are gated where people bring their dogs for them to play together. These spaces come fully prepared with water, bags, cleaning kits and even seats. I’ve seen friends hang out at the park while their dogs are having fun playing with other dogs. These parks usually also have 2 areas, one for smaller and one for larger dogs - which is great since we have a small pomeranian.</p>
<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-03-02-moving-from-london-to-the-bay-area-and-what-changed_16.png"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I'm very happy that I moved to the US. I think it was the right decision for both the company and my family. Plus the network that I'm building between other founders, customers and investors is something that I couldn't have done in Europe.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing the OpenBB Copilot, an ever-present financial analyst at your fingertips with the OpenBB Terminal Pro.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img width="600" src="https://didierlopes.com/blog/2024-02-27-openbb-copilot-now-available-to-all-terminal-pro-users.png"></p>
<p>For the past few weeks, we’ve been working on the OpenBB Copilot, an ever-present financial analyst at your fingertips with the OpenBB Terminal Pro.</p>
<br>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://openbb.co/use-cases/ai">OpenBB Copilo</a> is our latest addition to the <a href="https://openbb.co/products/pro">Terminal Pro</a>, and we could not be more excited to share it with you.</p>
<p>If you don't have access yet, join the <a href="https://my.openbb.co/app/pro/early-access">Terminal Pro waitlist</a> and enjoy your 3-week free trial soon!</p>
<p>Now, take a moment to meet your new <strong>AI investment research partner</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-the-openbb-copilot-do">What can the OpenBB Copilot do?</h2>
<p>OpenBB Copilot is multi-functional and can perform several tasks that are useful to analysts. We’ll be exploring these below.</p>
<h3 id="generic-financial-knowledge">Generic financial knowledge</h3>
<p>Using OpenBB Copilot, you can ask any general financial question. For example:</p>
<p><strong>What is the P/E ratio?</strong></p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/7c8c9658-4c4d-4090-8a61-826de823981b"></video>
<p>As an additional bonus feature, OpenBB Copilot includes a LaTeX renderer to display mathematical formulas and equations.</p>
<h3 id="conversation-capability">Conversation capability</h3>
<p>OpenBB Copilot is a conversational agent and is, therefore, aware of the chat history of the current conversation.</p>
<p>As a result, you can ask follow-up questions and steer OpenBB Copilot toward your line of inquiry while developing an investment thesis.</p>
<p>To clear the message history, for example, when investigating a new asset, you can click on the trashcan icon to start a new conversation.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/3e1170f2-59b4-458a-bc6e-cd86c688b8db"></video>
<h3 id="terminal-pro-as-context">Terminal Pro as context</h3>
<p>If you ask questions about the data on the dashboard, OpenBB Copilot will query the Terminal Pro for the data necessary to answer your query.</p>
<p>The Copilot has access to the dashboard metadata on the backend and can decide to retrieve data from any of the widgets currently on your dashboard.</p>
<p>In most cases, if you can see the data on your dashboard, you can assume OpenBB Copilot has access to it.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/6c22201f-67ce-49a7-ab4d-213b594c657b"></video>
<p>This is an application of what’s known in the AI world as function calling, which allows LLMs to interact with external systems.</p>
<p>The OpenBB Copilot can choose to automatically retrieve the data from your dashboard if it needs it to answer your query.</p>
<p>The advantage of this approach is that, since you can retrieve data from any widget, you can also expand OpenBB Copilot’s knowledge by adding custom widgets or by bringing your own data to the Terminal Pro.</p>
<h3 id="query-specific-widgets">Query specific widgets</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you may wish to focus your analysis and use OpenBB Copilot with only a specific subset of widgets.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to use OpenBB Copilot to assist you in a deep analysis of an earnings transcript in the "Earnings Transcript" widget without retrieving data from the rest of the dashboard.</p>
<p>To achieve this, you can chat with specifically selected widgets by clicking on the "Add widgets as context".</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/dc74b30a-73ed-4b85-af23-9bb8ab9c844c"></video>
<p>Selecting a widget will make that widget's data available to OpenBB Copilot while excluding all the other widgets.</p>
<p>You can then use the Copilot as normal and the unselected widgets will be ignored by the Copilot.</p>
<h3 id="query-your-own-documents">Query your own documents</h3>
<p>You’re also not limited by the data that is available in Terminal Pro.</p>
<p>You can upload your own documents for OpenBB Copilot to use as context while answering your queries.</p>
<p>OpenBB Copilot currently supports txt, PDF, CSV and XLSX documents.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/dec690c2-ed07-40c1-8b3e-ff0ad7294258"></video>
<h3 id="citations">Citations</h3>
<p>We understand that sometimes getting an answer from an AI chatbot with financial knowledge isn’t satisfactory.</p>
<p>You often want to do further research or do your own fact-checking of the sources used to answer to your query.</p>
<p>That is why OpenBB Copilot provides citations as part of its answers.</p>
<p>When using the Terminal Pro as context or chatting with your uploaded data files, the Copilot will cite which data sources it used to formulate the answers.</p>
<p>Simply mouse over the citation to see which widget data was used, or which uploaded file was referenced. For PDF document specifically, the Copilot will also source the specific page that was used to answer your query.</p>
<video controls=""><source src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/e35a0b2c-8150-4d2b-9743-a72862ba3b6d"></video>
<h2 id="what-if-you-dont-want-to-use-our-copilot">What if you don't want to use our copilot?</h2>
<p>You don’t have to. That is the reason we came up with the Bring Your Own Copilot concept.</p>
<p>If you’re an OpenBB Terminal Pro user, you’re able to bring your own financial Copilot that has been fine-tuned and tweaked on your enterprise’s private data.</p>
<p>This provides an edge to financial firms as they can access their own fine-tuned LLM with access to real-time data provided by the OpenBB Terminal Pro - making this the perfect combo to perform investment research.</p>
<p>We have an <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/copilot-for-terminal-pro/tree/main">open-source repository</a> to help you make your own copilots accessible on the Terminal Pro.</p>
<p>You can also see the video below:</p>
