<br>
<p>In this blogpost, I share my journey of creating a program to split household bills. This was my first side project where I used Java to create a GUI application.</p>
<p>The open source code is available <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/HouseholdBills">here</a>.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<p><strong>My first side project.</strong></p>
<p>Before University, I spent most of my spare time playing counter-strike (my steam account had <strong>more than 1000 hours played</strong>, that’s more than 41 entire days playing in a row). I was a decent player I’d say, you can see a compilation of “almosts” I’ve done <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocsJzNJJB50">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, I knew this wasn’t the way. I realised that if I used the amount of time I was spending on online games for learning, I would have a much bigger satisfaction return. And, in the long term, my life would be better.</p>
<p><strong>So I started studying hard.</strong> I started valuing my time more, and declined most of the parties I was invited to because I was busy working late hours. Don’t get me wrong, I’m an easy person. I like to think I make friends easily. However, I just had different priorities, and partying just wasn’t one of them. As my parents say: <em>“Everything has its own time”</em>.</p>
<p>In my 2nd year of University, I was getting really good grades, which means that I started having discussions with the other best students in the course. <strong>That’s how I met one of the smartest people I know to this day</strong>. This guy was a proper hands-on person, he didn’t study half the time I did, but he was always busy with something.</p>
<p>He had a band, developed his own personalised guitar pedals and amplifiers, and developed some apps for fun. He did this all while having excellent results at University, which is insane. That’s when I realised that he was not only giving more priority to these hobbies in relation to partying or meeting people, <strong>BUT also in relation to doing courseworks or studying for exams</strong>. He’d never fail a coursework/exam, but that further study could have bumped a grade from 17 to a 19 out of 20.</p>
<p>One day, we were meant to meet at his place to work on a coursework together, and he shown me an app that he had developed for him and his girlfriend. The app was a simple command line interface that was able to split their usual household bills (rent, water bill, food shop, cat food, etc). <strong>I found that fascinating.</strong></p>
<p>I told him I would create one for myself. Since I had read about how to use Java to make a pretty GUI, I thought why not give this a go (although I had no idea about OOP). In addition, I didn’t want my program to look the same as his, so I thought my version could be as if it was an upgrade.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After that, I was on a mission. Little did I know that after this, I never really stopped having an interest in working on new side projects.</p>
<p>The planning steps were:</p>
<p><strong>1. Decide main features.</strong>
Add new household bills to split, Give money, and See bills.</p>
<p><strong>2.Sketch what the GUI should look like</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Devise data structure associated with a new Household bill split.</strong>
This was important for both coding, and also database management.</p>
<p><strong>4. Work out the math associated with the splitting and giving</strong></p>
<p>The development process was to <strong>“divide to conquer”</strong>. I split the tasks into several sub-tasks, and after every new little code change I was testing the code to make sure that nothing was broken. I re-iterate through design and code several times, until I was happy with my solution. Then I did some clean-up/improvements, such as: Adding pictures of the users, Login password, Frenchies as icons.</p>
<p><strong>On a funny side note:</strong> As I didn’t know how to work with DBs at that time, I used text files to save and load all the information. Meaning that if my brother ever opened one of those text files (which weren’t properly hidden…), I could have passed from him owing me 100 euros to me owing him 10 million. The software was on his laptop, and I had an hardcoded password, so in theory he couldn’t manually add any bill without my presence — I guess that was enough for him to think that the product was bullet-proof.</p>
<p>See images below of the program:</p>

<br>
<p>You can find more information about this on my GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/DidierRLopes/HouseholdBills">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The program ended up being used for more than 3 years.</strong> Since I lived with other people other than my brother, I had to update the name/image on the program to represent that. Since I was new to coding, I didn’t think about the future. Therefore, when that time came, I had to manually replace the names one by one in the code. I also had friends requesting to use the program, which lead to me adapting this to their names/figures.</p>
<p>It was a fun project and I definitely learned loads from it. The most important thing was that I was able to do whatever <strong>I wanted software-wise as long as I dedicated enough time for it.</strong></p>
<p>Hope you had a fun read.
