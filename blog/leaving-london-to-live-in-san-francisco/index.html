<p>Leaving London to live in San Francisco: A personal journey of relocating and starting a tech company in the heart of Silicon Valley.</p>
<div style="border-top:1px solid #0088CC;margin:1.5em 0"></div>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I was born in Geneva, and when I was 8 years old, we moved back to Portugal, which is where my parents are originally from. After spending most of my teenage years in Portugal, I left sunny Lisbon âï¸ to pursue a MSc. degree at Imperial College London ð». Thatâs where Iâve been living and working up until now. The main reasons behind my desire to move to San Francisco âï¸ ð» are the weather and the thriving tech ecosystem that surrounds it.</p>
<p>During the Covid pandemic while in London, I took the opportunity to build my own <a href="https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal">personal open source investment research platform</a>. This project allowed me to secure VC funding and establish a company called <a href="https://openbb.co/">OpenBB</a>. As the CEO of this company, I feel privileged to have the chance to make a lasting impact on the financial industry. Embracing this adventure and collaborating with individuals who are much smarter than I am is the least I can do for our team and for OpenBB.</p>
<p>As a first-time founder, I often find myself feeling slightly behind, which is why Iâm eager to absorb as much experience and knowledge as possible from other successful entrepreneurs. This is also why I managed to convince my wife and our dogs to join me in packing our bags and embarking on this journey into the unknown, much like my Portuguese ancestors did centuries ago ð¢.</p>
<p>Now, letâs dive into what truly matters. This will be a lengthy ride, so make sure youâre prepared for the journey ahead.</p>
<h2 id="visa">VISA</h2>
<p>First of all, you need to determine which visa you are eligible for in order to live and work in the US. You can find more information on this topic <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In my case, I decided to apply for an âO-1 Visa: Individuals with Extraordinary Ability or Achievementâ and specifically highlighted my extraordinary ability in the field of Computer Science, specifically within the subfield of Automated Systems. It is crucial to specify a particular field to make the defense process smoother.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of working with an exceptional immigration lawyer who assisted me in crafting my case, significantly increasing my chances of a successful approval. Here is a portion of the O-1 Petition that was submitted:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/assets/images/2023-05-13-leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco_1-dfec710d307335974e46f7e7b87dcc51.png" width="1400" height="512"></p>
<p>As you can see, there is quite a bit of paperwork required to support your case. In my situation, I needed the following documents: Curriculum Vitae, university grades, transcripts and diplomas, LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, posts that gained viral attention on platforms like Reddit and HackerNews, podcasts and conferences where I had spoken, projects that received online praise, any media coverage I had received, scholarly scientific publications, expert opinion letters, and even emails or direct messages from venture capitalists or professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>Essentially, any relevant evidence is used to strengthen your case. For me, the most crucial elements were the expert opinion letters provided by our lead investor, former colleagues, or respected individuals in the field who were familiar with my work, as well as the research papers I had published and the media coverage I had received.</p>
<p>Once my O-1 visa was approved, I simply needed to take my passport to the US embassy in London to obtain the visa stamp. Itâs worth noting that if the wait time at the US embassy is lengthy, you have the option to visit another US embassy in another country where the process may be faster.</p>
<h2 id="arriving-to-the-country">Arriving to the country</h2>
<p>I arrived in California on my own initially, with the plan for my wife and dogs to join me later. Thankfully, I had some contacts in California who provided me with their phone number and house address, which was helpful for getting settled. Since I didnât have a phone before finding an apartment, I had to rely on roaming data using my plan from the UK, which resulted in additional expenses.</p>
<p>I would suggest either having a good deal for data roaming and international calls outside your country or obtaining a prepaid US phone. The latter is especially important if youâre traveling alone because I often encountered registration forms that didnât accept foreign phone numbers.</p>
<p>Regarding payments, I used my Revolut VISA card, which offers excellent foreign exchange rates for converting pounds to dollars. Itâs worth noting that I couldnât open a US bank account without a Social Security Number (SSN).</p>
<h3 id="social-security-number-ssn">Social Security Number (SSN)</h3>
<p>If you know someone in the US, it is advisable to apply for a Social Security Number (SSN) as soon as possible and provide their address and contact information if you donât have a US address of your own. An SSN is necessary for various purposes, and it may take up to two weeks for the card to arrive. When going to you nearest Social Security Administration (SSA) office, I would suggest arriving 30 minutes before opening hours to avoid long queues.</p>
<p>To apply for an SSN, you will need to bring the following documents to the SSA office: your passport, the I-797 form (O-1 visa approval notice), and the I-94 form (arrival record in the US).</p>
<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>
<p>I had the fortunate opportunity of having a friend lend me a car as soon as I arrived in California, and it made my life ten times easier. I highly recommend having something lined up in terms of transportation, as having a car enables you to get anywhere you need to go much more efficiently. To ensure I was covered, I simply needed to arrange car insurance. I opted for <a href="https://www.progressive.com/">Progressive</a>, and the process was quick and straightforward.</p>
<p>While settling in, I occasionally relied on public transportation instead of driving, especially when traveling to the center of San Francisco. It took me some time to adjust to driving in the US, so public transport was a convenient alternative. If you plan on using public transportation services like BART or Caltrain, I suggest visiting <a href="https://www.iliveinthebayarea.com/knowledge-center/transit/">this website</a> that provides information on available transportation options. Itâs also a good idea to purchase a <a href="https://www.clippercard.com/">Clipper card</a>, which allows you to load funds and easily tap it when boarding.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you anticipate passing through tolls, bridges, or utilizing the fast lane on the freeway, I recommend looking into acquiring a <a href="https://www.thetollroads.com/accounts/fastrak/transponder/">Fastrack transponder</a> for a more seamless experience.</p>
<h2 id="finding-an-apartment">Finding an apartment</h2>
<p>Apartment hunting proved to be quite stressful, considering that every day spent searching meant unnecessary expenses piling up while I still had my company to manage.</p>
<p>Using Uber for transportation was convenient and efficient, but the costs could add up quickly with multiple trips. To save money, I recommend scheduling house viewings on the same day in specific areas of interest and simply walking from one location to another.</p>
<p>While dealing with lease agents, I encountered a mix of competence levels. Some were highly efficient, while others were less so. If youâre genuinely interested in a particular apartment, itâs important to exert some pressure to keep the process moving forward. Donât hesitate to call and inquire about updates.</p>
<p>I was fond of the first house we saw, so I promptly paid $300, which covered certain fees. These fees were refundable if we decided not to proceed, but more importantly, they ensured that the house would be taken off the market. At this stage, both the agents and I wanted the process to move as quickly as possible. In our case, the target timeframe was three business days; if the process exceeded that, the house would be made available again.</p>
<p>Even if you believe youâve found the perfect apartment, I still recommend continuing your search until the lease contract is signed. Itâs crucial to secure the apartment before assuming itâs yours.</p>
<p>Before obtaining the keys, we had several tasks to complete: making the first payment, setting up utilities (<a href="https://www.pge.com/">PG&amp;E</a> for Gas and Electricity, and <a href="https://utilitiesinfo.conservice.com/">Conservice</a> for water), providing proof of renterâs liability insurance (I used <a href="https://assurantrenters.com/">Assurant</a>âs as it was conveniently associated with the community), and undergoing a pet screening (note that certain dog breeds are considered more dangerous and may not be accepted).</p>
<p>Most importantly, my salary alone wasnât sufficient to guarantee that we could afford the rent. I needed a guarantor to vouch for me, as Europe does not have the concept of credit ratings.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our lead investor graciously agreed to be our guarantor when I asked him. Without someone fulfilling this role, I would have had to rely on a third-party service and pay several thousands of dollars, which would have been non-refundable and solely for the right to lease the house. This arrangement seemed rather illogical.</p>
<h2 id="after-the-apartment">After the apartment</h2>
<p>I needed to notify <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">USCIS</a> of my new address since the last one on file was associated with the hotel where I was staying. I informed them that my new residence would be the updated address.</p>
<p>Following that, my dogs flew from the UK using <a href="https://www.petsabroaduk.co.uk/">Pets abroad UK</a>. To save money, my wife didnât accompany them on the flight; instead, she arranged for them to be transported in the cargo hold of the airplane while I waited at the destination.</p>
<p>However, I must admit that I didnât enjoy the experience, and in hindsight, I would have been willing to pay more for my dogs to have a better and safer flight. Although flying them from London, meant that unfortunately cargo was the option due to UK requirements. When I picked them up, they were visibly scared, and both my wife and I held our breath with worry throughout their entire journey. Our dogsâ well-being was of utmost importance to us.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/assets/images/2023-05-13-leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco_2-843e6257e49d6aa076b204ce8c6b43d2.png" width="1400" height="922"></p>
<p>The house was mostly empty, so to save money, we acquired a lot of second-hand items for free. It was beneficial to know people in the area who were aware of others with unused items stored in their garages, which we were able to take. To retrieve this furniture and other objects, we either needed to rent a U-Haul (which wasnât possible without a California driverâs license) or hire a moving company.</p>
<p>Our next task was to search for second-hand items at significant discounts on websites such as <a href="https://sfbay.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>, <a href="https://nextdoor.com/">Nextdoor</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace">Facebook Marketplace</a>. However, we had to be cautious of scammers and remember that if a deal seemed too good to be true, it probably was.</p>
<p>Once we had gathered most of the second-hand items, we visited <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/">Home Depot</a> to paint and improve the newly acquired furniture. For the items we couldnât find second-hand, we made purchases at <a href="https://www.costco.com/">Costco</a>.</p>
<p>We highly recommend getting an executive membership at Costco as it provides great value for money. Additionally, the gas prices at Costco are significantly cheaper compared to other places weâve seen.</p>
<h3 id="wi-fi--mobile-plan">Wi-Fi + Mobile plan</h3>
<p>After securing an apartment, I used my passport to visit an <a href="https://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> store. Since I didnât have my SSN yet, they were accommodating and allowed me to use my passport for identification. However, if you choose a different service provider like Xfinity, you will need your SSN. Before selecting a plan, itâs important to check the coverage in your area to ensure that 4G/5G works well.</p>
<p>Initially, I set up Wi-Fi through Xfinity, but then I used that as leverage to negotiate a discount with AT&amp;T. This worked because I was interested in a double play package, which included two phone plans and Wi-Fi. As a result, I obtained an e-sim with unlimited 5G data for both myself and my wife, along with Wi-Fi for our home, at a cost of approximately $150 per month.</p>
<h3 id="shopping">Shopping</h3>
<p>Thereâs going to be a big shock in terms of prices; at least, we experienced one. Life in the Bay Area is over 2x more expensive than London.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/assets/images/2023-05-13-leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco_3-3338b35f8a3a4c69fe8c6f3943b2346d.png" width="1248" height="874"></p>
<p>So, we started learning how to buy things at a lower cost. Whole Foods is not a viable option as itâs one of the most expensive stores. The 10 items above cost $69.34 on Whole Foods.</p>
<p>Instead, we now tend to shop at Safeway and always try to time our visits to take advantage of discounts. Many shopping places offer coupons that can help you save a lot of money. Additionally, when you come across products on sale, itâs better to buy them in larger quantities as itâs usually worth it.</p>
<p>My wife is also a big fan of Trader Joeâs with the prices there being quite reasonable too. They also have a great selection of cheeses which is a must being from Europe.</p>
<h2 id="after-obtaining-an-ssn">After obtaining an SSN</h2>
<p>After you obtain your SSN, there are a lot of new things that you are able to do since you are recognized as a âperson.â</p>
<h3 id="bank-account">Bank account</h3>
<p>Credit cards are recommended over debit cards, not just because of the security benefits, but also because of the credit rating associated with them. This is a concept that doesnât really exist in Europe but is significant in the US. Your credit score will determine whether you are approved for a loan and what interest rate you will be charged.</p>
<p>The agencies that handle your credit score are <a href="http://equifax.com/">Equifax.com</a>, <a href="http://transunion.com/">TransUnion.com</a> and <a href="http://experian.com/">Experian.com</a>. Itâs free to register, and you should keep an eye on your credit files to ensure that your credit score doesnât decrease for any reason.</p>
<p>We ended up opening an account with <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a>. However, since we didnât have a credit score yet, we couldnât get a regular credit card. Instead, we had to apply for a secured credit card, where the maximum spending limit is determined by the amount of cash we use to back the credit card.</p>
<p>We also applied for an <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-everyday/?eep=26129&amp;irgwc=1&amp;veid=39E0XuRS3xyNT4BTy33WSUXYUkAwp0Tx32Qt0c0&amp;affid=1193684&amp;pid=IR&amp;affname=NerdWallet%2C+Inc.&amp;sid=14011830016&amp;pmc=795&amp;BUID=CCG&amp;CRTV=controlaffcps&amp;MPR=03">AMEX card</a> because <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/">American Express</a> has a partnership with the international credit-reporting startup Nova Credit. This allows immigrants to instantly translate credit reports from the UK to U.S.-equivalent credit reports when applying for AmEx consumer cards. However, itâs important to note that AMEX cards are less widely accepted compared to VISA and MasterCard, so we were aware that they would only work in certain establishments.</p>

<h3 id="car">Car</h3>
<p>It was now time for us to buy a car. We searched online for a few options. There are two things worth considering when buying a used car, as we did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, you can use <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-values/">https://www.kbb.com/car-values/</a> to research the value of the car. This ensures that you donât get ripped off and provides an estimate of how much the car is worth based on the details you provide.</li>
<li>Secondly, you can use <a href="https://www.carfax.com/">https://www.carfax.com/</a> to research a car and its license plate. This helps you understand its accident history and any repairs it has undergone. It provides information about whether there have been major accidents in the carâs history, frequent visits to the mechanic, and whether the repairs were done by authorized mechanics (e.g., BMW) or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you prefer to play it safe, you can even bring a mechanic with you to the dealership to assess the carâs condition.</p>
<p>We spoke with individuals, but ultimately decided to buy a car from a dealership because it offered fewer risks compared to buying from individuals. Moreover, the dealership took care of updating the vehicle records, ensuring that the vehicle would be registered under our name. This allowed us to update our car insurance with the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of the new vehicle.</p>
<p>After a few months, we received the California Certificate of Title, which confirmed that I was the legal owner of the vehicle and included important vehicle identification information. Since this was my first car, I had to add an OpenBB reference to the front plate :)</p>

<p>Shoutouts to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jiffylube.com/">Jiffy Lube</a> for their car inspection services, tire inflation, oil changes, and more. They donât charge for the inspection and only charge for the services performed on the car. We had a great experience with them.</li>

<h3 id="health-insurance">Health Insurance</h3>
<p>California offers a portal called <a href="https://www.coveredca.com/">Covered California</a>, which provides state-approved health plans from various insurance companies. If your income is low, the state can subsidize your monthly premium. These plans fall into three categories, each with differences in costs and provider networks:</p>
<ol><li>HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations): Typically cheaper than PPOs, HMOs have smaller networks. You need to see your primary care physician before getting a referral to a specialist.</li><li>PPOs (Preferred Provider Organizations): Usually more expensive, PPOs offer a larger network and the ability to see providers outside of the network. You can also see specialists without a referral.</li><li>EPOS (Exclusive Provider Organizations): EPOS plans combine features of HMOs and PPOs. They have exclusive networks like HMOs, making them generally less expensive. However, you can make your own appointments with specialists, similar to PPOs.</li></ol>
<p>In our case, we chose an HMO called Kaiser. <a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/northern-california/front-door">Kaiser</a> is a not-for-profit, all-inclusive healthcare company with its own doctors and hospitals. When selecting the plan within Kaiser, we had to choose between Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers. These tiers are influenced by three main factors:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Monthly premium:</strong> The amount you pay each month for health plan coverage. It may be subsidized based on your income and household size.</li><li><strong>Annual deductible:</strong> The amount you must pay before your plan starts covering services.</li><li><strong>Annual maximum out-of-pocket:</strong> The total amount you pay in a calendar year (in addition to monthly premiums) for most services covered by your health care plan.</li></ol>
<h3 id="california-driving-license">California Driving License</h3>
<p>The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is responsible for vehicle registrations and driving licenses in California. When you arrive in California, you can use a foreign driving license for only 10 days, after which you must obtain a California Driving License (CDL).</p>
<p>To apply for the CDL, you can start the process online by completing the driverâs license application on the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/">DMV website</a>. This online application saves time by allowing you to fill it out before visiting a DMV field office.</p>
<p>When you visit the DMV, the employees will review your completed application and request certain documents, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Security Number (SSN)</li>
<li>Unexpired foreign passport with a valid U.S. visa</li>
<li>Approved I-94 form</li>
<li>Bank and financial institution records</li>
<li>Insurance documents</li>
</ul>
<p>After submitting the required documents, you will have your picture taken and then proceed to take the written driving test. Itâs advisable to practice for the test in advance. As I have many years of driving experience, I personally used practice tests available at <a href="https://www.dmv-written-test.com/california/practice-test-1.html">https://www.dmv-written-test.com/california/practice-test-1.html</a>.</p>
<p>A few days later, I returned to the DMV to take the written test. The test consists of 36 multiple-choice questions, and you are allowed to fail up to 6 questions. You will immediately know whether you passed or not.</p>
<p>Upon passing the written test, you will receive a document that allows you to schedule your driving exam. It is recommended to book the exam as soon as possible, as available slots may be several weeks away due to high demand.</p>
<p>On the day of the driving exam, you will need to bring someone who holds a CDL, the document provided after passing the written exam, and your passport.</p>
<p>The driving exam evaluates your performance, and you will receive a score sheet outlining the criteria and aspects that will be assessed during the exam. This will give you an idea of what to expect and what the examiners will be evaluating.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/assets/images/2023-05-13-leaving-london-to-live-in-san-francisco_5-2369d72acd845e145eec9fda83357fa9.png" width="1400" height="1050"></p>
<p>After successfully passing the driving exam, the DMV will issue you a temporary document that serves as your California Driving License (CDL). This temporary document will allow you to legally drive while you wait for your physical CDL to be sent to you by mail.</p>
<p>It typically takes a few months for the physical CDL to be processed and mailed to your designated address. During this time, you can use the temporary document as proof of your driving privileges in California. Once you receive the physical CDL, you should carry it with you whenever you are driving.</p>
<p>Itâs important to note that the temporary document and the physical CDL have the same validity and serve as official proof of your driverâs license status.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Iâve moved countries a few times within Europe, and those moves were much easier than moving to the USA.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think you can get settled within 3 months of moving to the country. So far, we are really enjoying our experience and canât wait to explore more of the area.</p>
<p>If you are looking to do the same and want some feedback, feel free to reach out. It helped us a lot to have people who could help us with the move, so Iâd love to be able to do the same for others.</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm
