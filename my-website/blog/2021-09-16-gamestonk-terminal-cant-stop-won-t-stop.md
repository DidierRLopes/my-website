Hey all,

Do any of you know what **Docker, Jupyter Lab integration, features website and new features** have in common? Well this is what has been happening in Gamestonk Terminal World since last month, and MORE!

**Docker:**
- This has been a highly requested feature from our more experienced dev users, as it allows you to run our code in a container, pull the image and then get going with a smooth installation process. You will also be able to run Jupyer Lab from our Docker container.

**Jupyter Lab Integration:**
- Jupyter is on course to take over the world (see here).
- Big investment banks like JP Morgan use Jupyter too, see this.
- Professionals in the industry such as Data Scientists, Data Analysts and Machine Learning engineers are familiar with the combo dockers+notebooks. Therefore, it makes our terminal an attractive Open-Source project to devote time to.
- Academia students and universities will be able to use terminal data through a notebook for their projects and coursework. We’re on track to be able to achieve something on this soon!

**Hugo Website:** https://gamestonkterminal.github.io/GamestonkTerminal/
- This will not only simplify a contributor’s documentation process, but it will also let non-Gamestonkers now see the vast number of features we offer and yes, when you read “offer” this is actually an offer since the tool is completely free to use.

**Main New features:**
- New Dark Pool Shorts menu
- Refactored and improved Crypto menu!!!
- Dark Pool and Crypto report generation
- Excel Discounted Cash Flow created by a MBA student
- Big code refactoring to allow for contributors to easily get started with our codebase
- Contributing document (click here).

**Tier 2 features:**
- Sentiment Investor data features implemented by the SI team themselves
- Feature/fraud indicators implemented by a MBA student
- Multiple plotting for economy data for more insight extraction
- Screener presets to not miss out on promising tickers
- Several new Technical Analysis indicators, e.g. Fibonacci, Fisher transform, Centre of gravity, zlma, Donchian channels…
- Unusual options activity
- Hot penny stocks in discovery menu
- A contributor implementation of a realtime earnings expected move, from The Geek of Wallstreet
- Several new YahooFinance commands to discover promising tickers
- Refactor Exploratory Data Analysis and Residual Analysis menus into a Quantitative Analysis one

As if this wasn’t enough, we’re also working towards a Discord bot so you can make best use of our terminal when discussing trading strategies with your friends. This was an initiative from a contributor, which just goes to show how much we rely on our community to drive our project.

If you appreciate what we’re doing and want a better free and Open-Source financial tool, you should definitely star the project on our github here, join our Discord channel, and follow our twitter account. Not necessarily in that order! :)

Have you been following our project and want to join our growing community? Here are a few tips on how to get started:
- Join our Discord and tell us about your experience so far
- Let us know what else you would like to see in the terminal
- You can help to improve our crypto terminal, which is 99% taken care of from our contributors!
- Help us add any features! You don’t know python? This may be your cue to learn with our team!

Much love!
