Almost 2 years ago, I started building my own investment research platform. 2 months later I named it Gamestonk Terminal, made it open source and shared it on Reddit. The rest is history.

Since then, we surpassed 17,800 stars on Github. Raised $ 8.8 million in our seed round. Build a very competitive team and our OpenBB brand is now recognized by most in the financial space. You can read more about our story here.

**Our mission to democratize investment research has not changed.** Over the past few months we have been heads down and building and today I’m excited to share with you the announcement of OpenBB Terminal 2.0.

The headline is:

_OpenBB Terminal 2.0 is more than an application, it’s a platform._

A summary:

- We are releasing OpenBB SDK which allows developers to use a single API to access the world’s raw financial data in order to build their own products / dashboards.

The SDK will allow users to create report templates in a matter of minutes and run them for custom tickers at any time in a matter of seconds; Instead of spending hours and starting a report from scratch every single time. We envision a world where the community can share these and help each other at becoming better investors.

- We are also bringing a state-of-the-art AI / ML toolkit to the financial industry, to be used alongside all the data sources our platform has access to (stocks, crypto, NFTs, options, forex, ETFs, mutual funds, macro economic data and even alternative data).
