OpenBB team is comprised of 18 FTE.

We have 8 products: OpenBB Platform, OpenBB Terminal, OpenBB Bot, OpenBB Terminal Pro, OpenBB Excel Add-In, OpenBB Hub, OpenBB Docs and Marketing website.

This means that on average we have around 2 people working on each product.

This is particularly wild when you look into the complexity associated with each of these products and being at the forefront of innovation.

That average includes not only engineers but design, product, and marketing.

In addition, our Discord community has 14k+ people and we often get praised regarding how good our support is.

Regardless of our future, I am proud of the team we put together and how efficiently we operate.

It would take a much larger company well over 5 years to build what we built in 2.
