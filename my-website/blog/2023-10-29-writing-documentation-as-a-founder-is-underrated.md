This blog post emphasizes the importance of writing documentation as a founder. It discusses how it can give an edge when pitching your product and how it can result in less customer support and a better user experience overall.

A founder spending time writing documentation is f*king underrated

Working on your product documentation may not be the most rewarding task, but I strongly believe that it gives you an edge when pitching your product.

Good documentation needs to strike the perfect balance between having enough context and being straight to the point.

This week someone asked us how many people worked on our documentation.

There have been less than 3 people working on it. Our North Star metric has been common sense and putting out documentation that we would enjoy reading/learning from ourselves.

Earlier this year I also heard suggestions of hiring a dedicated technical writer.

I think that’s BS, at least at the early stages of your company.

It’s the equivalent of saying that you should hire someone to tell your company vision or that the first sales shouldn’t come from the founders.

No one knows your product better than yourself. And users (particularly devs) will notice the love put into documentation. + This will result in less customer support and a better user experience overall.

Honestly, a very underrated task if you ask me.
