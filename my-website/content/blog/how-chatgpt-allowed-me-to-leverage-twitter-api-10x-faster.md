# How ChatGPT allowed me to leverage Twitter API 10x faster

For a while now, users have been asking for adding real-time financial news on OpenBB Terminal.

Since OpenBB Terminal is a command line interface for the world‚Äôs financial data, and there is no threading going on ‚Äî there was never a very straightforward way to do this.

**Until today.**

After recalling this tweet from Elon earlier in November, I realized that I‚Äôve been using Twitter for news substantially more than MSM.

So, my next train of thought was; What if I was able to somehow display the latest tweets from Twitter accounts that I trust. In particular, accounts that have up-to-date information and usually mention the words ‚ÄúJUST IN‚Äù or ‚ÄúBREAKING‚Äù. E.g. @WatcherGuru or @unusual_whales.

By doing this, I could then use the bottom of the OpenBB Terminal to highlight the news. An example of this is below:

## Coding and ChatGPT

The next step for me was to implement the code!

First, I needed to understand how I could have access to the last tweet of a specific user account. I already had a Twitter API account created, which meant I already had the key, token and secrets, therefore, I just needed to read documentation to understand how to use the Twitter API. Hence, I started reading Twitter‚Äôs developer documentation.

The day before I had been playing around with ChatGPT. And like everyone else, I was very impressed. One of the things that surprised me the most was how good it was at outputting working code with an explanation along the lines.

So, while I was reading the documentation, I was thinking ‚ÄúI wish there was a way for me to just be able to get the last N tweets of an account without needing to dig in the developer documentation‚Äù. Could ChatGPT be the answer?

So I tried‚Ä¶

This was already amazing. But I‚Äôm lazy and didn‚Äôt want to copy all the cells individually to put it into a Jupyter notebook, so asked ChatGPT to provide the code output as a single block. I wasn‚Äôt convinced it was going to work. But it did.

‚Ä¶ it just worked. ü§Ø

After that, I needed the timestamp associated with the tweet, to see how old it was. As usual, I started looking into Tweepy documentation.

**Ups, what was I doing again?**

After a couple of seconds, I went onto ChatGPT and asked how I could get the timestamp of a tweet using Tweepy library.

And ü™Ñ, it worked again!!!

One thing that is for sure: ChatGPT is going to truly disrupt many industries. And I will be here for it.
