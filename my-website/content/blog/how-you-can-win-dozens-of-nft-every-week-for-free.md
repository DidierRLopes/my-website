# How you can win dozens of NFT every week for free

This year I started getting into the whole NFT rabbit hole. I’ve observed that more and more people are trying to innovate and create their own pieces of art. Some of them are impressive, some of them aren’t. But,

_Beauty is in the eye of the beholder — Margaret Wolfe Hungerford_

However, in my humble opinion, what distinguishes some art from others, is most of the time not the art itself but the community around it. For example, when everyone starts talking about the ‘new best thing’ you feel more pressure to get involved.

Because of this dynamic, creators are investing in ways to increase their collectibles popularity by building their community. A great example is ParallelNFT and the dystopian story that is being created around their cards — in their case, it’s fairly easy to understand that once a big community is formed around such cards, video games, movies and even series are on the table. For the first time ever, we would go from selling collectibles to creating some form of entertainment.

**A whole new industry in the making.**

However, not every digital creator has the resources to create a full concept around their cards. Does this mean that they can’t create a community around it? No. But they must find other ways.

One of the most popular ways I’ve seen is through giveaways. Similar to what small clothing brands do to increase their popularity. This is a great tactic in my opinion, since giveaway not only give you a bigger audience (people that participate and re-share content) but it makes the cards have multiple owners. This, as a result, makes the collection more attractive for NFT collectors.

_When demand exceeds supply, **prices tend to rise**._

And these creators are using Reddit as the platform of their giveaways.

When scrolling through reddit you will notice that all these posts have certain things in common:

- They ask for an up-vote on the post
- A comment with your wallet address
- To favourite their artwork
- They may also ask to you to join their Discord
- For a follow on their Twitter or Instagram
- If you can retweet or share a story

These are things that take time, and a bot can perfectly do this. Therefore, I wrote a giveaway NFT bot to do this. While I sleep.

This bot: upvotes, comments and opens their Opensea link for me to favourite their artwork.

The bot has made me won dozens of NFTs, which is exciting — you never know where the next CryptoPunks are at.

Hope it allows you to win dozens of NFTs too.
