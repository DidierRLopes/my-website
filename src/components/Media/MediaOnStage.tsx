In response to an inflow into a mutual fund, for example, a group of agents might build a list of buy orders using the OMS, stage the orders to an EMS, review liquidity conditions to craft a trading strategy and send orders to the broker algorithms best suited to execute the orders, rather than requiring traders to interact with several applications. What are the challenges, risks and benefits of creating and deploying autonomous agents in the investment management enterprise?",
